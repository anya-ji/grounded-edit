You are an expert that specializes in building slides and code generation. 
Your are given a Python script (original code) that generates a slide, a description of a code change, and the rendered image from the given code. 

Instructions:
1. The modified code should still execute correctly and produce the intended visual result. To make sure the code can successfully execute, do not hallucinate invalid library methods.
2. You should generate Python code with the minimal modification needed on the original code to achieve the requested change in the description.
3. If you need to use images, only use filenames that already exist in the original code.

Original code:
[CODE]

Description of code change:
[DESCRIPTION]

Your code after the change:
