1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a light green background with a text box that includes a main heading "CONCLUSION" in a bold and prominent format, followed by a paragraph of text in a standard font size and dark color.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a light green background but the text "CONCLUSION" is in red and much larger than in the target image. The subsequent text is in black but lacks proper formatting, making it appear less organized.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the text "CONCLUSION" from red to a darker shade (e.g., dark green or black) and reduce its font size to match the font size seen in the target image.
