1. Description of Target Image: The target image features two text boxes with an orange background for "Define the term Market" and a yellow background for "Explain how products reach to market," both with rounded corners and clear, bold white text. The overall look is well-integrated with a contrasting black background and a clean, modern aesthetic.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has an orange box for "Define the term Market" and a yellow box for "Explain how products reach to market," but the yellow box appears more fluorescent and the text does not stand out as clearly against it. The text also seems to be less bold than in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the "Explain how products reach to market" box from fluorescent yellow to a softer, more muted yellow to match the tone of the target image, and increase the text weight to bold for better visibility.
