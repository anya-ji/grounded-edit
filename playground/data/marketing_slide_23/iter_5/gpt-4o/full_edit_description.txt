1. Description of Target Image: The target image features two text boxes with black and orange backgrounds, containing the text "Define the term Market" in a bold font and "Explain how products reach to market" in a regular font. The background is predominantly black with a textured design.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but the background is altered to include a lighter gray, with the first text box highlighted in bright orange and the second in dark gray. The bold font is used for both text entries, but the second entry appears to be blank instead of displaying the complete text.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image text boxes to match the black background of the target image.
