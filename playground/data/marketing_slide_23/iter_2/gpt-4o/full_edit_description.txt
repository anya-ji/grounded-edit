1. Description of Target Image: The target image features two blocks with text; the first block is orange with a rounded corner while the second is darker with a bold font, both over a black background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same two blocks, but the first is orange with a square corner, and the second block has a yellow background and non-bold text.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the second block's background color from yellow to a dark shade similar to the target image, and make the text bold.
