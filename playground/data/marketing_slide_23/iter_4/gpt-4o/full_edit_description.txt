1. Description of Target Image: The background features a sleek, curved structure, and two orange buttons labeled "Define the term Market" and "Explain how products reach to market" are displayed prominently on the left side.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The background shows a similar sleek, curved structure, but the buttons have different colors (yellow and dark gray) and the text on them is formatted differently, making it less visually aligned with the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the button labeled "Define the term Market" from yellow to orange to match the color in the target image.
