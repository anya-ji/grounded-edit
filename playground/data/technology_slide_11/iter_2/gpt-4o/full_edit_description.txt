1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a list of disadvantages of blockchain programming with each item formatted as a check box that is unchecked. The list includes bullet points on the left and a text box on the right with additional details, all presented in a clean, structured layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays the same content but with each bullet point formatted in a different way. The check boxes appear to be styled differently and have inconsistent spacing, and the text on the right is presented without proper alignment.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the check box style to match the target image, ensuring that all check boxes are uniformly styled and positioned consistently with equal spacing from the text.
