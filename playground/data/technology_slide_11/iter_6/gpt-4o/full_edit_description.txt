1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a list of blockchain disadvantages with the text clearly outlined and a box that contains additional points on the right side labeled "Transparency, Security, Streamlined, Enhanced analytics, Customer satisfaction." The points are properly aligned and visually distinct, including a vertical line indicating the categorization under "Disadvantages."

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image includes a list of blockchain disadvantages that is similar to the target image, but it has a missing vertical line separating the two distinct sections. Additionally, the formatting is uneven, particularly in the alignment of the points listed under disadvantages.

3. Change Suggestion: Add a vertical line separating the "Disadvantages" list from the additional points on the right to match the formatting of the target image.
