1. Description of Target Image: The target image consists of a flowchart titled "From Factory to the Market," featuring four steps (Producer, Wholesale, Distributors, Retailer) with colorful orange and blue shapes, uniform text, and clear layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also has the same flowchart title, but it includes poorly aligned text, an inconsistent color gradient from blue to white, and a white missing background for the "Distributors" step.
3. Change Suggestion: Add a solid white background to the "Distributors" shape to match the backgrounds of the other steps.
