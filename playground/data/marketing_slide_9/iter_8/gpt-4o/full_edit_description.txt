1. Description of Target Image: The image features a flowchart titled "From Factory to the Market" with four steps (Producer, Wholesale, Distributors, Retailer). Each step is enclosed in vibrant orange rectangles with a light background, and the text is clearly legible with appropriate coloring and alignment.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has similar content but features a light blue background and the step boxes are in orange with an octagonal shape. The text is misaligned, particularly in the second step, and lacks the clarity and structure seen in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background color of the rendered image to a light color similar to the target image, maintaining the orange rectangles while fixing the text alignment in the second step with clear spacing and formatting.
