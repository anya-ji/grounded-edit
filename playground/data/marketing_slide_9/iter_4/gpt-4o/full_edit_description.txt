1. Description of Target Image: The image contains a labeled flowchart featuring four steps in a process, with colorful boxes containing text descriptions for each step, presenting a gradient background that enhances readability.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The image displays a similar flowchart layout but with only two of the four steps filled in. The background is a gradient from blue to white, and some box outlines are missing, leading to a less organized appearance.
3. Change Suggestion: Add the missing text boxes for steps 3 (Distributors) and 4 (Retailer) in the same style as the other boxes, ensuring they have a consistent background color and visible outlines.
