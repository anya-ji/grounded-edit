1. Description of Target Image: The image features a flowchart titled "From Factory to the Market," with a gradient background. The sections marked "Step 1: Producer," "Step 2: Wholesale," "Step 3: Distributors," and "Step 4: Retailer" have orange and light-colored backgrounds, with text clearly explaining each step in a traditional rectangular format.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The image also displays a flowchart with the same title but uses an angular format with a blue-to-white gradient background. The "Step 2: Wholesale" section has an orange background but lacks clarity and structure compared to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background of the "Step 2: Wholesale" section from a lighter blue to a solid orange color to match the target image's color scheme and enhance visibility.
