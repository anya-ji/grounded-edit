1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide with a light green background and dark green text. The slide includes a clear image of a tree within a transparent bubble, placed on a gradient background with varying green shades.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A presentation slide with a uniform light green background and green text. The image of the tree within the bubble appears similar but lacks the gradient background seen in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Add a gradient background to the rendered image, transitioning from light green at the top to a darker green at the bottom, to match the target image more closely.
