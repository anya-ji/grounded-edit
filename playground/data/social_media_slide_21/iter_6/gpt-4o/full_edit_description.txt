1. Description of Target Image: The text reads "THANK YOU!" in a bold, clean font with an exclamation mark after "YOU" and a space before it; the characters are evenly spaced and proportional.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The text reads "THANK YOU! U!" where "U" replaces "YOU" and is not part of the main phrase; the overall spacing appears uneven and "U!" is less prominent.
3. Change Suggestion: Change "U!" to "YOU!" to match the target image and ensure consistent text formatting and spacing.
