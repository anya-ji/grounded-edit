1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title "KEY reasons why academic success is important in society" with subheadings that are bold and colored yellow, alongside illustrations and text that are well-aligned and formatted clearly within sections.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title but a less bold format for the text and yellow subheadings that appear misaligned. Some text content does not line up properly and has a missing part in the "Personal Growth and Development" section.
3. Change Suggestion: Ensure that the text for "Personal Growth and Development" includes "fulfilling careers" completely, and adjust the alignment of all section headers so they match the target image's formatting and positioning.
