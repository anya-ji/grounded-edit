1. Description of Target Image: The target image features three segments highlighting personal growth, employability, and economic impact, with each segment accompanied by illustrations. The text titles and bullet points are clearly structured and formatted with distinct font styles and colors to enhance readability.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays similar content but has overlapping text, inconsistent formatting, and a less structured layout. The titles and bullet points merge into one another, making it difficult to read.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the text layout to ensure each section's titles and bullet points do not overlap and maintain a clear, consistent font size and style for better readability.
