1. Description of Target Image: The target image features three sections with text highlighting aspects of academic success in society, including "Personal Growth and Development," "Employability and Career Opportunities," and "Economic Impact." Each section has relevant illustrations and properly formatted text with a cohesive layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has similar sections, but the text layout is misaligned, with some sections overlapping. Text formatting is inconsistent, specifically the headers are misaligned, and the bullet points are not clearly separated.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the vertical position of the text in the "Employability and Career Opportunities" section to eliminate overlap with the preceding section, ensuring all text is clearly visible and properly aligned.
