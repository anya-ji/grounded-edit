1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clean layout with clearly legible text headlines and descriptions. The sections are well-organized, and each section has distinct colors for the headers and illustrations, enhancing readability.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has overlapping text that disrupts readability. The main headline is overly large, causing important elements to be obscured, while the text color in some sections contrasts poorly against the background, making it hard to read.

3. Change Suggestion: Reduce the font size of the main headline "KEY REASONS WHY ACADEMIC SUCCESS IS IMPORTANT IN SOCIETY" to 1.5em and ensure it is centered to prevent overlap with the subsequent text.
