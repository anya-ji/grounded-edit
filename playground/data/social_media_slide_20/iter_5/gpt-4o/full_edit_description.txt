1. Description of Target Image: A document slide with bold text at the top stating "Three perspectives on global cultural flows:" followed by the section title "3. CULTURAL CONVERGENCE" in a large font. The paragraph text below is in a standard font, and the background is a solid blue color. The text is well-organized, with clear bullet points and spacing.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar document slide that retains the same title and content structure, but the bullet points are not presented as checkmarks. The background color is the same, but the text appears more crowded or less formatted than in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the bullet points in the rendered image to be formatted as checkmarks (âœ“) instead of standard bullets, ensuring they align with the style of the target image.
