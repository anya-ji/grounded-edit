1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title and text that are bold and clearly readable, with a blue background that is consistent in color and brightness.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but features a slightly darker shade of blue in the background and the text lacks sufficient contrast, making it less readable.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background color of the rendered image to match the exact shade of blue used in the target image to improve text visibility and consistency.
