1. Description of Target Image: The target image shows a clear and organized lesson reflection section with a few questions highlighted, and there is a visible area on the screen showing a dynamic and engaging classroom activity with vibrant colors and graphics.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features a similar lesson reflection section but is less organized, with some text overlapping and a less visually appealing design. The background is plain, and there are graphical elements on the side that are not as engaging or colorful.
3. Change Suggestion: Enhance the rendered image by improving the layout of the lesson reflection section to align the text properly, ensuring that no text overlaps, and use a more vibrant background color to make it visually appealing.
