1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a lesson reflection layout with three numbered questions inside speech bubbles and a background featuring abstract designs, complemented by a video player icon and a section for quiz and review activity.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features a plain background with no text in the foreground. It contains the same "LESSON REFLECTION:" header but lacks the questions, speech bubbles, and decorative elements present in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Add three numbered questions in speech bubbles to the upper left section of the rendered image, replicating the content and design of the target image.
