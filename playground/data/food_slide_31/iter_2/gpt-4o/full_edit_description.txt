1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a light gray background with a rectangular layout that includes a border, sidebar elements, and a clear outline of lesson reflection questions. The text is easily readable with a dark blue font.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a light blue background and lacks the defined borders present in the target image. The layout appears more cluttered with less distinct separation between elements, and the font color is less pronounced, making it harder to read.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image from light blue to light gray and add a thin dark border around the main content area for improved clarity and separation of elements.
