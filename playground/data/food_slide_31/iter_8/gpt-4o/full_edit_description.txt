1. Description of Target Image: The target image presents a "Lesson Reflection" header in a dark blue box, with question prompts in a visually engaging layout, including rounded text boxes and varying colors for emphasis. The background is light gray with some abstract shapes.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar header but is displayed in a lighter blue color. The question prompts are plain and without any distinctive design elements, and the background is a solid shade of blue.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the header color to a dark blue and introduce rounded text boxes for the question prompts, similar to the target image, to enhance visual appeal and create contrast.
