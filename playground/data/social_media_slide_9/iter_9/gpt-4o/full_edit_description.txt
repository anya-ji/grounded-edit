1. Description of Target Image: The target image contains the title and points about cultural globalization formatted with a clear distinction in font size, style, and line spacing. The text features a regular font for the title and a larger size for the list items, with a defined bullet point structure. 
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has similar content but is inconsistent in font style and size. The list items are presented with a semi-colon, and the overall formatting lacks clarity, with some sentences merged without proper spacing.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the list item formatting in the rendered image so that each point is presented as a bulleted list with a line break before each new point, similar to the target image.
