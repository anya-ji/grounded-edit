1. Description of Target Image: The text is displayed in a clear, organized, and properly formatted manner, with consistent numbering and punctuation in the list. The last line is smoothly connected to the preceding content.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The text lacks proper consistency in numbering, with an incorrect numbering format for the list items, and an additional line break that disrupts the flow before the last sentence.
3. Change Suggestion: Correct the numbering format from "1." and "2." to a consistent numbering style, ensuring that the last line flows correctly without an extra line break.
