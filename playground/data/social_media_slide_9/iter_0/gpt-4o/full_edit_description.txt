1. Description of Target Image: The target image contains a well-formatted text with proper heading capitalization, distinct bullet points, and a continuation of the paragraph without abrupt breaks.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows similar text; however, it has inconsistent capitalization in the heading and a missing continuation of the paragraph at the bottom, which causes an abrupt ending.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the heading in the rendered image to capitalize "The" in "The media have a very important impact" for consistency with the target image.
