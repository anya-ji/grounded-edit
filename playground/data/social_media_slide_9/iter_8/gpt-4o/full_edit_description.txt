1. Description of Target Image: The text maintains consistent formatting and uses a larger font size for emphasis. The last line contains a single statement without a preceding number.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The text features variations in font size and formatting, with the second statement incorrectly numbered. The last line includes a numbered list format, which does not match the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the font size of the bullet points to match the target image and remove the numbering from the second statement in the rendered image.
