1. Description of Target Image: The text is formatted with a clear, standard layout where "The media have a very important impact on cultural globalization..." is in blue, and the subsections are numbered without any unusual spacing. Each sentence is clearly formatted with proper punctuation.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The text is similar but features inconsistent spacing, particularly an extra line breaks, and a blue coloring that seems to have an incorrect alignment with the text structure and includes improper punctuation for the last point.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the spacing between the lines to ensure there are no additional line breaks between the sections, maintaining uniform spacing similar to the target image.
