1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a collage of people expressing the sentiment "It's about the people, not the places" with a well-composed layout and clear visibility of the text.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image is a similar collage, but the bottom text has been altered and partially obscured, making it difficult to read.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the positioning of the text in the rendered image to ensure it is fully visible and not cut off at the bottom.
