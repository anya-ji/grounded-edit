1. Description of Target Image: A collage featuring various people interacting in relaxed settings with a bold text overlay that reads, “IT’S ABOUT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE PLACES.”
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar collage with the same text overlay, but it appears slightly cropped and has an incomplete bottom section where some people are cut off.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the cropping of the rendered image to include the full bottom section of the collage, ensuring all individuals in that section are visible.
