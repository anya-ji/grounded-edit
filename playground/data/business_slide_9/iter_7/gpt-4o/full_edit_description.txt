1. Description of Target Image: A collage featuring various people enjoying time together, with a prominent quote that reads "IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE PLACES" in a bold white font across the center.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar collage of people with the quote partially displayed; however, the text is cropped, missing the beginning part of the phrase.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the cropping of the rendered image to fully include the text "IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE," ensuring the entire quote reads "IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE PLACES."
