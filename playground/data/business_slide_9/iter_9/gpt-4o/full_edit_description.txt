1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a collage of people enjoying each other's company, with a large text banner reading "IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE PLACES". The people appear engaged and smiling, highlighting a sense of connection.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image is similar but has a minor visual difference; it retains the text but lacks some of the liveliness present in the target image. The colors appear slightly less vibrant, and the peopleâ€™s facial expressions seem less expressive.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the saturation and contrast of the rendered image by 10% to enhance the vibrancy and expressions of the individuals in the collage.
