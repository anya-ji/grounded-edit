1. Description of Target Image: The target image contains multiple scenes of people interacting in diverse settings, with a prominent slogan "IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE PLACES" in bold white letters over the scenes. The image has a textured background and contrasting colors that enhance the visibility of the text and scenes.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but the text has been altered to "S ABOUT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE PLACES," omitting the first letter of the slogan. The colors appear less vibrant compared to the target image, and the visual contrast between text and background seems weaker.
3. Change Suggestion: Modify the text in the rendered image to read "IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE PLACES" in bold white letters, ensuring the text contrast with the background matches that of the target image.
