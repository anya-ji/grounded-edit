1. Description of Target Image: The target image has a light blue background with a large bold black font for the question, and the options are presented clearly, with the correct choice marked by a green checkmark at the bottom.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features a light blue background as well, but the font for the question is not bold, and the correct answer is marked in a different style with a checkmark positioned slightly off from the bottom.
3. Change Suggestion: Make the font of the question bold and ensure the green checkmark is positioned precisely at the bottom of the answer options for consistency with the target image.
