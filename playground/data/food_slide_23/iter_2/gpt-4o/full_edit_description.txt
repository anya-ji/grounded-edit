1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a question about pronunciation rules with options listed below. The background has a subtle, professional gradient, and the answer choice 'c' is marked with a green checkmark.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image presents the same question with the same options, but features a slightly different background color and the checkmark appears in a different style or color, potentially less vibrant, affecting its visibility.
3. Change Suggestion: Modify the color and style of the checkmark in the rendered image to match the vibrant green color and bold style of the checkmark in the target image.
