1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a question and answer format in a user interface with a clear layout, including tick marks for correct answers, and is visually organized with a light blue background for selected items.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features the same content but has a cluttered layout with beige color tones, lacks clear distinctions between answered and unanswered items, and does not use color coding effectively to highlight selections.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the selected answer row to a light blue, similar to the target image, to enhance clarity and visual consistency.
