1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a structured layout with three cultural product images displayed in a neat row, along with a title and explanatory text above them.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a less organized layout, with the title presented in a larger font and the images arranged in a more clustered manner without clear separation.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the alignment and spacing of the images in the rendered image to ensure they are evenly spaced and aligned in a straight row, similar to the target image.
