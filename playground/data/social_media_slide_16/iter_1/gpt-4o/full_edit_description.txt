1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a presentation slide with a title "Global and Local Cultural Products," a section titled "Cultural Products," and a bullet point list explaining cultural products. There are three images displayed: a colorful textile, a traditional doll, and an architectural structure (Sagrada Fam√≠lia), all aligned left to right.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image is similar but with a minor layout difference. The title is in a bold blue font, and the images are positioned differently, with increased space between them and misalignment with the text area.
3. Change Suggestion: Align the images in the rendered image to match the left-to-right positioning in the target image, reducing space between the images for consistency in layout.
