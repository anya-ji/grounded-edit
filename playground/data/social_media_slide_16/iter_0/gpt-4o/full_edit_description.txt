1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title "Global and Local Cultural Products" in a darker blue header, with block text below that includes a check mark. It shows three cultural items: a colorful woven textile, a traditional Japanese doll, and the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, all evenly sized and aligned.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a brighter blue header and the text is in a different font. The same three objects are displayed but the images of the textile and the doll appear smaller compared to the Sagrada Familia, causing visual imbalance.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the size of the woven textile and Japanese doll images to match the size of the Sagrada Familia image, ensuring all images are uniformly sized for visual balance.
