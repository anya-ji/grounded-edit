1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a network-like structure with white circular nodes connected by light blue lines on a blue background. It has a clean layout and informative text about the ZENEROM company.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows a similar network structure; however, the image is cropped on the left side, cutting off part of the visual structure and the accompanying text appears misaligned and incomplete.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the cropping of the rendered image to include the entire left side of the network structure, ensuring that the full visual content is displayed without cutting off any elements.
