1. Description of Target Image: The target image shows a 3D graphical representation with circular nodes connected by lines, all placed on a smooth blue surface, accompanied by text on the right side, including a company description and contact details.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features a similar 3D graphical representation of circular nodes and lines but has text overlaid on the top part of the image, partially covering the graphic and altering the overall layout.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the position of the text to be below the 3D graphic so that it does not overlap and fully displays the visual elements.
