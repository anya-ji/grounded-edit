1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clean layout with a network of white circles and light blue lines against a smooth blue background. Text overlays are positioned to the right of the graphic, enhancing clarity and visibility.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar graphical layout but the text overlay is too large and obscures part of the network graphic. Additionally, the background color behind the text is black, detracting from the overall design.
3. Change Suggestion: Reduce the size of the text overlay to ensure the network graphic is fully visible and adjust the background color of the text area to a lighter shade that matches the overall theme of the target image.
