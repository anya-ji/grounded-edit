1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a blue background with white cylindrical and circular components connected by light blue lines, along with text on the right side.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays a similar blue background and white components, but the text is obscuring a significant portion of the image, covering a part of the graphic elements at the bottom left.
