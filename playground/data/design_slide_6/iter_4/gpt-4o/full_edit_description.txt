1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a digital marketing presentation with visual elements of connected nodes and links against a blue background, with text clearly displayed on the right.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar background and visual elements, but the text placement overlaps with the visual elements, making it less readable and visually consistent with the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the text box position to ensure it does not overlap the visual elements on the left, aligning it more closely with the right side of the image for improved readability.
