1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a visually appealing layout with a network design made of white circular nodes connected by light blue lines, set against a smooth blue background. The text on the right is clearly visible and well-organized.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same network design but has a significant cut-off on the right side, leading to an incomplete view of the text, which appears cluttered and less readable.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the bounding box of the rendered image to include the entire text content on the right to ensure it is fully visible and maintains proper margins.
