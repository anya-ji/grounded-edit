1. Description of Target Image: The top image features a yellow background at the top, with a soft, warm gradient and abstract patterns of red, orange, and white swirls throughout, presenting a subtle texture. The references section has a yellow background with a slight shadow and clear separation from the abstract design behind it. 
2. Description of Rendered Image: The bottom image shows a similar abstract background but with a yellow background that appears lighter and a pink background at the bottom of the references section that contrasts sharply with the yellow, making it less seamless and somewhat jarring.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the references section in the rendered image to a soft yellow that matches the target image, ensuring that the color transition blends smoothly with the surrounding abstract background.
