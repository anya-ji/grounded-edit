1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clearly structured text layout with emphasized stressed words highlighted in red, making them stand out for easy identification.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows a similar text layout but lacks consistent formatting for stressed words, which are not highlighted correctly.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the font color of the stressed words in the rendered image from regular text color to red for consistent emphasis as seen in the target image.
