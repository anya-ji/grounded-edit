1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clear layout with a title "Pronunciation Activity" prominently displayed at the top in bold letters, followed by two parts with instructions. The text is easy to read with proper formatting, including bullet points and clear section headings.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows a similar layout but lacks visual emphasis on the title. The text appears smaller and lacks clarity, making it harder to follow.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font size of the title "Pronunciation Activity" and make it bold to enhance visibility and emphasis.
