1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a well-structured worksheet with clear headings, interactive elements, and emphasized text in red, making it easy to read and engage with.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image is similar in content but lacks visual clarity, with large, bold headings that overpower the rest of the text and no visual emphasis on key interactive parts.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the font size of the headings to be smaller and use a standard font weight instead of bold to create a more balanced visual hierarchy while enhancing the readability of the content.
