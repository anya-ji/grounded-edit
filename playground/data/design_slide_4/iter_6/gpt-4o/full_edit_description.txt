1. Description of Target Image: The target image features text boxes with blue backgrounds and white text; the alignment of the text is uniform and consistent, with proper spacing and hierarchy.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has similar text boxes but with variations in text alignment and spacing. Some text boxes are larger than others, and the text alignment is inconsistent, particularly for the "Website composition" section.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the height of the "Website composition" text box to match the height of the "Marketing and advertising design" text box, ensuring consistent spacing and alignment across all text boxes.
