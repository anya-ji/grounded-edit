1. Description of Target Image: A visually balanced text layout with consistent alignment and font element sizes. The sections are clearly spaced, and the text is easily readable with a uniform background color.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A text layout with inconsistent font styling and alignment, where the background color is darker than in the target image, leading to a less cohesive overall appearance.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to match the lighter background color of the target image for improved readability and visual consistency.
