1. Description of Target Image: The target image features several blue boxes with white text and appropriate spacing, with a header titled "Types of graphic design" in a bold font. The text is well-structured and clear, with consistent alignment.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but displays inconsistencies, such as improper font weight for some titles and uneven spacing between the text boxes, leading to a less polished look.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the font weight of the header "For more professional assistance" to match the others by setting it to bold.
