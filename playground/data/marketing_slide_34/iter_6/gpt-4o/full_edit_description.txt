1. Description of Target Image: The target image has a subtle gradient background transitioning from teal to a lighter shade, with white text on the left side saying "Let's Recall:" and larger white text below saying "Differentiate between Wholesaler and Retailers." There is a small red square in the top right corner.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features a darker blue gradient background, with the same text but in a different alignment where "Let's Recall:" is now on the left side while "Differentiate between Wholesaler and Retailers" is on the right. The red square is much larger than in the target image and located in the top right corner as well.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background gradient of the rendered image to match the target image's lighter teal colors, ensuring a smoother transition in shades.
