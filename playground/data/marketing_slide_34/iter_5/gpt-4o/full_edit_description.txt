1. Description of Target Image: The target image has a smooth teal gradient background with white text that emphasizes the title "Let's Recall:" and the subtitle "Differentiate between Wholesaler and Retailers". The text wrapping is neat, and the overall appearance is professional and visually appealing. There's a small red rectangle in the top right corner.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a gradient background that transitions from teal to blue. However, the text appears larger and bolder, particularly in the subtitle. The color scheme also has a more contrasting red rectangle in the top right corner, making it stand out too much from the overall composition.
3. Change Suggestion: Reduce the font size of the subtitle "Differentiate between Wholesaler and Retailers" in the rendered image to better match the text size found in the target image.
