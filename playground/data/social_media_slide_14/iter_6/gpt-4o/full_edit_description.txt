1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a well-formatted text layout with clear differentiation between text blocks and a balanced presentation of graphics beside the text. The 'Digital media' section has a specified ending without repetition, and the overall font style is consistent and professional.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image contains redundant text in the 'Digital media' section, where the sentence is repeated. The layout appears cluttered and less organized, with inconsistent font styles and formatting compared to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Remove the repeated sentence in the 'Digital media' section to create a more concise and tidy appearance, similar to the target image.
