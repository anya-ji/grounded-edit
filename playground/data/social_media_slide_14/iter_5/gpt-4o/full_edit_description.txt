1. Description of Target Image: The target image contains several points about globalization and media, formatted in a professional layout with bold titles and consistent text size, visually clear and engaging, featuring two figures interacting with various media icons around them.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays similar content but has larger, bolded titles. The font size and formatting of the main text appear inconsistent, with some sentences being less visually prominent than the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the font size of the last sentence in the main content ("Digital media through phone and computers allows people to access information from around the world.") to match the size of the text in the target image for consistency.
