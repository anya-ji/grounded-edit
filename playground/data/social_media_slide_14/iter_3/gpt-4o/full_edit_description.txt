1. Description of Target Image: The text is presented with varying font weights, specifically with bold formatting used to emphasize the headings and important points. The figures on either side appear engaged and expressive, enhancing the visual appeal.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The text in the rendered image is mostly uniform in weight, lacking the bold formatting seen in the target image. The figures are shown in a similar pose but appear less expressive, diminishing the overall engagement of the image.
3. Change Suggestion: Apply bold formatting to the phrases "Globalization isnâ€™t possible to occur without media," "Electronic media allowed opportunities to spread all over the world," and "Radio and Television is a powerful mass medium in providing accessible information for people" in the rendered image.
