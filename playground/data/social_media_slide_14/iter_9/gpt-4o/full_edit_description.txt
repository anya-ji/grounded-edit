1. Description of Target Image: The text is neatly formatted with bold sections, including key phrases. The background is white, providing a clean look, with colorful icons next to illustrated characters engaged in conversation.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The text is less organized, with a lack of proper spacing and the last sentence about digital media not separated into its own line. The background is also white, but the formatting is inconsistent.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the font size and formatting of the last sentence, "Digital media through phone and computers allows people to access information from around the world." to ensure it is separated into a new line and matches the style of the other text blocks.
