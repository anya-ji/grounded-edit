1. Description of Target Image: A text box containing definitions of "MEDIA" and "CULTURE" with relevant content, having a background color of white and a blue header. The text is aligned neatly in a structured format.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar text box with definitions of "MEDIA" and "CULTURE," but the background color is blue without a clear white section, and the text is misaligned and visually cluttered.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to white for the text area while keeping the blue header intact to match the target image's clarity and organization.
