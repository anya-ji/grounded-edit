```
1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title "DEFINITION OF TERMS" at the top, with two definitions below it. The text "MEDIA" is in a larger bold font, and the text "CULTURE" is also bold but smaller than "MEDIA." The background has a dark blue color, creating a clear contrast with the text.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image includes the same title and definitions, but the font sizes for "MEDIA" and "CULTURE" are identical, removing the differentiation in hierarchy. The background color is still similar, but the text formatting is less effective.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the font size of the word "MEDIA" to be larger than that of "CULTURE" to re-establish the visual hierarchy in the rendered image.
