1. Description of Target Image: A clean and structured layout with the title "DEFINITION OF TERMS" at the top, featuring two definitions (MEDIA and CULTURE) clearly presented without overlapping text or distractions.
2. Description of Rendered Image: Similar layout but with the background dark blue, causing the text to blend in. The definitions are misplaced, overlapping, and lacking clarity.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background color to a lighter shade to ensure the text is clearly visible and separate the definitions to prevent any overlap.
