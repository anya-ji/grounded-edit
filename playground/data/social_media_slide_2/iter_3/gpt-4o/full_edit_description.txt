1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a header titled "DEFINITION OF TERMS" with two definitions underneath, one for "MEDIA" and one for "CULTURE." The text is formatted with bold headings and body text, with a consistent blue background on top and white background beneath the definitions.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also has the same header "DEFINITION OF TERMS" but lacks the blue background under the header, causing the definitions to appear with an empty space above them and a different vertical spacing that looks unbalanced.
3. Change Suggestion: Add a blue background behind the definitions section in the rendered image to match the target image.
