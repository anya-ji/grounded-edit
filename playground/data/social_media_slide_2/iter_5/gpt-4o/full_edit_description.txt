1. Description of Target Image: A document titled "DEFINITION OF TERMS" with a white background and blue headers. The text is clear, and there are defined sections for "MEDIA" and "CULTURE" with specific formatting.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The same document but with a blue background instead of white, making the text less legible. The header is also bold and slightly larger, but the overall layout is similar.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color from blue to white to improve text readability and ensure it closely matches the target image.
