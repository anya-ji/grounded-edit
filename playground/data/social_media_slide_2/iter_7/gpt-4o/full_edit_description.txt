1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays well-defined text with a bold font and clear contrast against a dark blue background, retaining proper spacing and formatting.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same text but lacks sharpness, has a grayish background, and the text appears less bold and slightly misaligned.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font weight of the text to "bold" and ensure the background color is set to deep blue (hex code: #003DA5) for better contrast and clarity.
