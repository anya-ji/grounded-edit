1. Description of Target Image: The target image contains a header in bold white text "DEFINITION OF TERMS" with a dark blue background. Below it, the term "MEDIA" is in bold uppercase with a description underneath, followed by the term "CULTURE" also in bold uppercase with its description below. The layout is structured with well-aligned text.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar header but with a light blue background. The "MEDIA" and "CULTURE" text descriptions are visible, but the "MEDIA" term is cut off and appears incomplete at the bottom. The alignment and font weights also appear inconsistently.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the height of the text box containing "MEDIA" to ensure that the full definition is visible and not clipped at the bottom.
