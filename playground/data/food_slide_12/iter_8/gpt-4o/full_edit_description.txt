1. Description of Target Image: The target image includes a video still from "*Friends*" of the character Joey Tribbiani, with the subtitle text reading "Ha, ha. No." positioned directly beneath him. The text and image are framed within the context of a viewing activity, maintaining a clean layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same video still of Joey Tribbiani, but the subtitle text "Ha, ha. No." is now positioned to the right of the image rather than beneath it, disrupting the original layout.
3. Change Suggestion: Move the subtitle text "Ha, ha. No." to be directly beneath the image of Joey Tribbiani, maintaining the original style and placement of the target image.
