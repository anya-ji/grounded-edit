1. Description of Target Image: The target image has a title "Friends | Joey Doesn't Share Food!" in a bold font over an episode scene, with a "VIEWING ACTIVITY" section prominently displayed at the top left corner, and the text below is also bold.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays the same title but lacks bold formatting. The "VIEWING ACTIVITY" header is in a standard font, and the overall text appears smaller and less prominent than in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the font style of the "VIEWING ACTIVITY" section in the rendered image to bold and increase the font size for better prominence, matching the style in the target image.
