1. Description of Target Image: The target image has the title "Friends | Joey Doesn't Share Food!" prominently displayed at the top, with a subtitle that is in bold text and slightly larger in size. The main content is centered, featuring a scene with a character on a couch, alongside dialogue.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays a similar scene but has a different format and layout. The title appears with reduced prominence, and the subtitle is smaller and not bolded. The overall layout has the text "FLUENT" at the bottom in a yellow font, which is absent in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the text "Viewing Activity" to "Friends | Joey Doesn't Share Food!" and make the subtitle bold and larger to match the title in the target image.
