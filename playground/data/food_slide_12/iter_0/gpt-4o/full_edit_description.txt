1. Description of Target Image: The target image shows a 'Viewing Activity' title in an engaging font, with an interactive video segment displayed, and the text "Friends | Joey Doesn't Share Food!" prominently shown on the right side.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but the 'Viewing Activity' title is partially cut off at the top, and the text below is less visually engaging, with a different representation of "FLUENT" at the bottom.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the top margin of the 'Viewing Activity' title in the rendered image so that it is fully visible and aligned properly at the top of the frame.
