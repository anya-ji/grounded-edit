1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title and description with standard font formatting, showcasing logos for Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Apple, and Adidas arranged horizontally with a consistent red and white design and proper spacing.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but includes an extended description text that is improperly formatted, and the Coca-Cola logo is displayed with a different font style, lacking the distinctive white script.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the Coca-Cola logo in the rendered image to a version that features the classic white script on a red background for accurate branding representation.
