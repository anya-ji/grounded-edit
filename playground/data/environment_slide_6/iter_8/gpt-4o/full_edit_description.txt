1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide featuring the title "Human impact or influence on environment" with a well-structured layout, clear text, and an image of a sunset landscape at the bottom right.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar presentation slide with the same title but with poorly structured text, a different font style, and the landscape image is stretched horizontally compared to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the aspect ratio of the landscape image to match the dimensions used in the target image to avoid distortion.
