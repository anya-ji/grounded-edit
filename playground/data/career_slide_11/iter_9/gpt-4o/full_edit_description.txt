1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide titled "IMPORTANCE OF SKILLS BEYOND ACADEMICS," featuring well-organized bullet points under various categories such as "Effective Communication," "Problem Solving and Critical Thinking," "Emotional Intelligence," and "Adaptability and Resilience," with clearly defined text and spacing.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar presentation slide with inconsistent bullet point formatting and changes in wording, particularly in the "Effective Communication" section, which is less clear and more cluttered.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the text in the "Effective Communication" section to match the original phrasing in the target image, specifically changing it back to "Strong communication skills encompass the ability to convey ideas clearly, listen actively, and adapt communication styles to different audiences."
