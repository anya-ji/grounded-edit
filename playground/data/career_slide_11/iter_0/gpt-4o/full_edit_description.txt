1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title text in large, bold white font stating "IMPORTANCE OF SKILLS BEYOND ACADEMICS," followed by bullet points in white text explaining various skills like Effective Communication, Problem Solving and Critical Thinking, Emotional Intelligence, and Adaptability and Resilience, all in white font on a darker background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title, but the only portion of the text that is in bold is the first bullet point, "Effective Communication." The rest of the text is in yellow font, making it less consistent with the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change all bullet points in the rendered image to white text, matching the font color used in the target image for consistency.
