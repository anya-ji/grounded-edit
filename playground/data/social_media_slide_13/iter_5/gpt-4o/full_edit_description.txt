1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide with a header stating "3 Factors that have affected the process of Economic Globalization" and a point describing the influence of public policies on economic integration, with proper text alignment.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar presentation slide but lacks proper text alignment, resulting in a disorganized appearance of the text block under the header.
3. Change Suggestion: Align the text in the rendered image to match the text alignment in the target image, ensuring it is properly justified or left-aligned as seen in the target.
