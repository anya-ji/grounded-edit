1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a slide with a blue header containing the title "3 Factors that have affected the process of Economic Globalization" and the content has well-defined margins with clear text formatting, ensuring readability and structure.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same header as the target image, but the content area lacks defined margins, resulting in text that is poorly aligned and appears cluttered with excess whitespace, affecting overall readability.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the content margins to align them with the header, ensuring consistent spacing that enhances readability and structure.
