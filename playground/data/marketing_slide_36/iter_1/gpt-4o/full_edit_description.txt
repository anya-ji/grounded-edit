1. Description of Target Image: The target image features three retail types: General Stores, Department Store, and Chain Store, with a consistent background color and proper image alignment.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same retail types but has a gradient background that transitions from blue to turquoise, and the text is centered over the images, causing some overlap.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background color to match the solid color of the target image and ensure the images are properly aligned without overlapping text.
