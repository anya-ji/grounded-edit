1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide with a dark blue background and a header "5 Stages of Development of Media." The text discussing oral communication is well-formatted with bullet points. An illustration shows a group of people communicating with speech bubbles.
2. Description of Rendered Image: Similar to the target image but has a mismatched background color where the text is placed and the text itself is not formatted as bullet points; it is written in a paragraph form.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the text section to match the dark blue of the target image, and reformat the text into bullet points for clarity.
