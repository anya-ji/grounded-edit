1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a group of five people engaging in a discussion, with a vibrant array of speech bubbles above them in various colors, including orange, green, pink, and yellow. The text overlay is crisp and clear.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image closely resembles the target image but has a few differences, particularly in the color and layout of the speech bubbles. The colors appear slightly muted, and the text is not as clear as in the target.

3. Change Suggestion: Increase the saturation of the speech bubbles in the rendered image so that the colors match the more vibrant hues seen in the target image, particularly focusing on the orange and green bubbles.
