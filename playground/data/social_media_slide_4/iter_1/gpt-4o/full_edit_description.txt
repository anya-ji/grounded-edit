1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title "5 Stages of Development of Media", with the first point "1. ORAL COMMUNICATION" displayed prominently. Below it, there are bullet points explaining the role of language in communication. The graphic on the right shows a diverse group of people engaged in conversation, with colorful speech bubbles above them.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title and first point about "ORAL COMMUNICATION". However, the bullet points are slightly altered in wording compared to the target. The image on the right still depicts the group of people conversing, but the colors and shapes of the speech bubbles are slightly different.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the wording of the bullet points in the rendered image to match the phrasing of the target image, ensuring they are identical: "• Language allowed humans to communicate and share information. • Language became the most important tool for exploring the world and different cultures."
