1. Description of Target Image: The target image shows a checklist with certain items marked with checkmarks, while some remain unchecked. The overall design appears professional and clean with clear markers for completed tasks.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays checkmarks that appear to be filled in incorrectly, with many items indicated as completed when they should remain unchecked. The design is similar but includes visual discrepancies in task completion markers.
3. Change Suggestion: Modify the rendered image by removing the checkmarks from the first three items in the list to match the target image.
