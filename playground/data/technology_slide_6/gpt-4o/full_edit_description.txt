<edit>Change the bullet points from checkboxes to standard bullets by updating the list format in the Python code to use a bullet point style, e.g., `plt.text()` instead of checkmarks.</edit>
<edit>Adjust the size of the title "Purpose of Blockchain" to increase its font size to be larger, such as `fontsize=36`.</edit>
<edit>Increase the line spacing between the bullet points to ensure better readability, using a value such as `lineheight=1.5` in the text properties.</edit>
<edit>Change the text color of the bullet points to a darker shade, such as `color='black'`, to enhance readability against the background.</edit>
<edit>Modify the background color of the slide to a lighter shade, such as `plt.gcf().set_facecolor('#f0f0f0')`, for better contrast with the text and elements.</edit>
