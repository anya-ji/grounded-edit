1. Description of Target Image: A list of events from Joey's second date with Sarah, presented in a structured format, including correct ordering of the incidents.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar list with events from the date, but the order of some events is mixed up.
3. Change Suggestion: Reorder the events to place "2. Joey doesnâ€™t like the dessert he orders and tries to order a different one." as the first event instead of "6. Joey apologizes for getting angry that Sarah took his food on the first date."
