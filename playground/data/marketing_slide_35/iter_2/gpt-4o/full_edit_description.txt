1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a well-structured layout with a gradient green background and gold-colored boxes for "Mobile retailers" and an orange-red box for "Fixed – Shop Retailers," both containing clear text and a downward arrow between them.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a plain white background with a gradient green box for "Types of Retailers" at the top, yellow and orange boxes for "Mobile retailers" and "Fixed – Shop Retailers," and a blue arrow pointing downwards between them. The text appears less clearly defined.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color from white to a gradient green similar to the target image to enhance visual coherence and make the text pop.
