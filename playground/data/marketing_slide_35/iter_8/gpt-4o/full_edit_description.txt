1. Description of Target Image: A visually simple and clean infographic showing two types of retailers with a gradient background, with "Mobile retailers" in a light yellow box above and "Fixed – Shop Retailers" in a reddish box below, aligned with arrows connecting them.
2. Description of Rendered Image: An infographic with a gradient background where "Mobile retailers" is in a bright yellow box at the top and "Fixed – Shop Retailers" is in an orange box below, but the layout is slightly misaligned and includes an arrow pointing down instead of a connector.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the arrow pointing down in the rendered image to a direct connector arrow that aligns the two retailer boxes, similar to the target image.
