1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a structured layout with two distinct boxes containing text, one golden yellow for "Mobile retailers" and the other a rich orange for "Fixed – Shop Retailers." The text is aligned to the left and the overall background is a gradient of dark teal and lighter teal.
  
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout, but the boxes have changed colors to bright yellow and orange. The text is also centered within the boxes and an arrow is added between the two boxes, diverging from the structured look of the target image.

3. Change Suggestion: Change the box color for "Fixed – Shop Retailers" from orange to a more muted shade similar to the target's color palette, ensuring it aligns with the target's color tones.
