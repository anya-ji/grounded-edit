1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide with a green background, featuring bold text in a darker shade of green for better readability, and clear, dark text for the body content.

3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color to a softer green shade (e.g., #B2EBF2) to enhance readability without overwhelming the viewer.
