1. Description of Target Image: The target image features text with a green and black color scheme, where the heading is in a bright green font and the body text uses a standard black font. The layout is clean and well-organized with consistent font sizes.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a green font for the entire text, including the heading and body. The layout appears slightly cluttered with a less organized font size and spacing.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the heading font color from green to a brighter green shade (e.g., HEX #00B300) while keeping the body text in black for improved contrast and readability.
