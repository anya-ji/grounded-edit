1. Description of Target Image: The target image features vibrant wall art with clear, large text overlaying graffiti, emphasizing "Components of visual communication." The eye illustration is prominently displayed, surrounded by colorful designs and splashes of paint. The text is aligned neatly and is clearly legible against the background.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows similar wall art and text, but the text appears slightly distorted and misaligned. The colors are vivid, but the text overlay does not contrast well with the background, making it harder to read. The composition lacks the same clear structure as the target image.

3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the text overlay to increase the contrast against the background by adding a subtle darker shadow effect to the text, improving legibility while keeping the alignment and size consistent with the target image.
