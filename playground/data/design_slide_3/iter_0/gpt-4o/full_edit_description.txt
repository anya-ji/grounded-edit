1. Description of Target Image: A colorful mural featuring an eye, with vibrant greens and yellows, and text in a clean font stated above the eye, clearly legible.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar mural but with more muted colors and shadows, and text overlapping the eye, making it less legible and visually cluttered.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the text positioning to move it higher up on the image, ensuring it does not overlap with the eye, and change the font color to white for better contrast.
