1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a vibrant mural with detailed colors in the eye and surrounding signage, including cleaner lines and distinct areas of color without any visual distortion.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image replicates the mural but appears with excessive drips and less vibrant colors, creating an overall duller look with some color bleeding and less clean lines around the eye.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the saturation of the colors in the eye and surrounding areas to make them more vibrant and distinct, reducing any bleed or drip effects.
