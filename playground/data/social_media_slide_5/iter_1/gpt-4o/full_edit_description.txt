1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a section of text referring to "2. SCRIPT," with the text formatted in a clear, concise manner and utilizing a list structure. The background appears neutral and there is an image on the right that depicts a fragment of an ancient manuscript.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also presents the text "2. SCRIPT," but the text is displayed in a paragraph format, which affects readability. The background remains neutral, and the manuscript image on the right is similar to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Modify the text formatting to use bullet points for the list items in the rendered image to match the target image's structure.
