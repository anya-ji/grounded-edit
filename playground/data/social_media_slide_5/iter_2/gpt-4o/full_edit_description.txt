1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a segment of text titled "2. SCRIPT" with formatting features including bold text for "SCRIPT" and an overall structured layout with bullet points.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features similar content as the target but presents "2. SCRIPT" in plain text, missing the bold formatting; it also lacks bullet points and has an unoptimized layout.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the text "2. SCRIPT" to bold formatting and add bullet points for the list items to match the style of the target image.
