1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title "2. SCRIPT" with the word "SCRIPT" in bold font, and the text below it has a specific layout with bullet points and clear spacing.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the title "2. SCRIPT" in bold but uses a different format where the text is not in bullet points and lacks uniform spacing, creating a less structured appearance.
