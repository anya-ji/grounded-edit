1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a slide titled "5 Stages of Development of Media," with a subheading "2. SCRIPTS." The text is organized into two bullet points, with a faded parchment-style background to the right featuring handwritten text.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title and subheading as the target image, but the text is more prominently displayed without bullet points, and the background parchment effect is less faded and more contrasting.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background of the rendered image to mimic the faded parchment effect of the target image for better visual consistency.
