1. Description of Target Image: The target image shows a vibrant painting of a bouquet of red flowers in a colorful vase against a light background, with petals scattered on the table.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image presents a similar bouquet but has a blue background and presents the painting in a less vibrant manner, particularly affecting the saturation and brightness of the colors.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background color from blue to a lighter hue similar to the target image to enhance the vibrancy of the flowers and match the overall lighting more closely.
