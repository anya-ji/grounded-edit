1. Description of Target Image: A colorful funnel diagram subdivided into sections labeled "Aware," "Interested," "Considering," "Intent to Buy," "Evaluation," and "Buy," with accompanying labels for "Marketing" and "Sales" on either side in a stylized font.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar funnel diagram with the same sections and labels, but with the labels "Marketing" and "Sales" rendered in blue at the sides and the overall color scheme appearing dimmer compared to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the "Sales" labels from blue to the same vibrant color used in the target image (matching the red for "Marketing").
