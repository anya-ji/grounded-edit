1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a funnel diagram with the words "Marketing" and "Sales" in red and blue, respectively, positioned at the sides, with a visual gradient of colors from red at the top to green in the middle, and a blue "Buy" section at the bottom. Each segment is clearly labeled.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also contains the funnel diagram with similar labeling, but "Marketing" and "Sales" are both in red text and have a different alignment that is not consistent with the target image. Additionally, the right part has a cloud of words related to marketing, but there is a different font and style.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the "Sales" text from red to blue to match the color scheme of the target image.
