1. Description of Target Image: The image features a funnel diagram labeled "Traditional" and "High Velocity" with categories like "Aware," "Interested," and "Buy" in a colorful gradient. The words "Marketing" and "Sales" are prominently displayed in red and blue, respectively, with a clean layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image closely resembles the target but has a slightly different layout. The words "Marketing" and "Sales" are also in red and blue, but they have shifted in placement and orientation from the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Reposition the "Sales" labels on the sides of the funnel to mirror their placement in the target image, ensuring they are vertically aligned and maintain the same orientation.
