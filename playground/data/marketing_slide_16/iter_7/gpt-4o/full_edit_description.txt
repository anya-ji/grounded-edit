1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a marketing funnel diagram with properly aligned color segments, each labeled, and "Sales" and "Marketing" labels positioned in blue and red respectively. The overall design is coherent and visually balanced.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has similar elements but features misaligned text where the "Sales" labels appear in blue but are distanced from the segments, causing a less cohesive appearance. The "Marketing" labels are overlapping with each other and are not as prominent as in the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the positioning of the "Sales" labels in the rendered image so that they align directly next to their corresponding segments in the funnel, ensuring consistent spacing and visibility like in the target image.
