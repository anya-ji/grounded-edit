1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a funnel diagram with colored layers labeled "Aware," "Interested," "Considering," "Intent to Buy," "Evaluation," and "Buy," with the terms "Marketing" and "Sales" in red and blue respectively. It is clearly formatted with structured sections.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also depicts a funnel diagram relatively similar to the target but has a different layout, with overlapping "Marketing" and "Sales" labels in red and blue, which appear misaligned and less clear.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the position of the "Sales" labels to align them consistently and ensure they are positioned clearly without overlapping, similar to the alignment in the target image.
