1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a marketing funnel diagram with clear labels "Marketing" and "Sales" on the sides, and vibrant color tiers representing different stages (Awareness, Interested, Considering, etc.). The "Sales" label is distinctly blue and the "Marketing" label is red.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image closely resembles the target but features the "Sales" label in blue on the left side and incorrectly displays "Marketing" adjacent to "Sales," with some areas overlapping.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the positioning of the "Marketing" label on the left side to remove any overlap with the "Sales" label, ensuring it is correctly located in the funnel without interfering with the "Sales" label.
