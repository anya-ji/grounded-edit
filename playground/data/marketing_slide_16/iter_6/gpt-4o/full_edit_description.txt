1. Description of Target Image: A marketing funnel diagram with distinct color layers representing different stages, labeled with "Marketing" and "Sales" in red and blue fonts, respectively. The overall structure is visually clear with a clean layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar marketing funnel diagram; however, the text colors for "Marketing" and "Sales" labels appear inconsistent and overlapping in some areas. Also, the term "Sales" is prominently misaligned with the design, appearing differently.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the color of the label "Sales" to a consistent blue and ensure it aligns properly with the respective section of the funnel, similar to the target image.
