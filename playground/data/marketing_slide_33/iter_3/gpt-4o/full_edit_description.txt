1. Description of Target Image: The target image features two murals: the top mural shows a diverse group of people advocating for equality, with a prominent red sun behind them. The bottom mural depicts various individuals engaged in actions representing resistance and history, with clear text slogans.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a green background, incorrectly oriented text, and the murals appear smaller and less vibrant compared to the target image. The layout does not reflect the same arrangement as in the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color from green to a light blue or white to match the color scheme of the target image and enhance contrast with the text and images.
