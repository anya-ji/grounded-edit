1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a presentation slide with a header in yellow and a clear, white text box containing a bulleted point about "National Pride and Glory." The text is easy to read against a muted textured background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but features an overly bright, yellow header and a semi-transparent white text box that is less readable against a vibrant, swirling background.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the transparency of the text box in the rendered image to be fully opaque to improve text readability against the background.
