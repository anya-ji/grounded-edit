1. Description of Target Image: The image features a dark background with a quote about success. The words "Success," "Skills," and "Experiences" are highlighted in different colors: "Success" in yellow, "Skills" in green, "Experiences" in blue, and "Personal Attributes" in red. The text is centered, and there's also an illustration of a trophy and a target with an arrow hitting the bullseye.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same text but the background is black. The word "Skills" is in green, but "Experiences" is colored red instead of blue, and the ending period of the sentence is placed after "Attributes" instead of before it. The visual elements are otherwise similar, including the trophy and target illustration.

3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the word "Experiences" from red to blue.
