1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a dark background with a clear and vibrant layout, including images of four individuals with their names and titles in yellow text. The names stand out prominently against the dark background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a lighter background that reduces contrast with the text, which is in white. The names are not as prominent, and the overall visibility of the text is lower compared to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to a dark color (like the target image) to enhance text visibility and contrast.
