1. Description of Target Image: A group of four successful individuals with a dark background and highlighted text. Each individual's name and title are prominently displayed, alongside details of their education in a clear format.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The same group of four individuals but with a light background, and the text is less vibrant. The education details are in a less defined font and style, making them less visually appealing and harder to read.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to a dark shade similar to the target image to enhance text visibility and create a cohesive look.
