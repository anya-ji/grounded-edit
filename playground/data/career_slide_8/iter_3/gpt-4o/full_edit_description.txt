1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clean layout with portraits of four successful individuals, each with clear backgrounds, uniform text placement, and properly formatted educational details directly below each person's name.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a more cluttered layout, with inconsistent spacing between portraits, some educational details misaligned, and less clarity in the text presentation.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the spacing between the portraits in the rendered image to match the consistent spacing used in the target image, ensuring that each individual's section is evenly separated for improved visual clarity.
