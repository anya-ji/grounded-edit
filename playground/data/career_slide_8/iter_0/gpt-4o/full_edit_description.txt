1. Description of Target Image: A visually cohesive presentation featuring portraits of four successful individuals with their names and educational backgrounds clearly displayed. The background has a dark color, enhancing the readability of the text, which is mostly white or yellow.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar layout with portraits and names of the same four individuals, but the background is a lighter shade, making the text blend more than stand out. The text color is mostly yellow, but the contrast is less effective against the background.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to a darker shade (e.g., black or dark grey) to improve text visibility and match the visual impact of the target image.
