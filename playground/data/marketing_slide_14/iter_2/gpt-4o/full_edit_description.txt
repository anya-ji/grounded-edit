1. Description of Target Image: A gradient background featuring two-tone blue and green, with a prominent question text overlaid: "Q. How often you think about social impact of your action before you act?" The background displays faint silhouettes of people.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A darker gradient background with more pronounced three-dimensional figures of people, but it features a large white obfuscating bar that covers the center and obscures the text.
