1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a header with the word "References" in a large, white font against a dark background, with several hyperlinks listed in blue below it.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has "References" in large white font but the links are also in blue against a dark background, presenting a slightly different style and layout.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the text size of the hyperlinks in the rendered image to be slightly smaller than the header "References" to create a clearer visual hierarchy.
