1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a header with a dark gray background and the word "References" in bold white text, with hyperlinks formatted in blue underneath.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout, but the "References" text is larger and bold but in a different font style. The hyperlinks are also a different shade of blue and appear less uniform.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the font style of the "References" header in the rendered image to match the font style of the target image, specifically using the same font type as the target image.
