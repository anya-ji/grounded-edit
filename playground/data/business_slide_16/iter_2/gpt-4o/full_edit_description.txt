1. Description of Target Image: A slide with a dark grey header that says "References" prominently displayed, followed by blue hyperlinks pointing to various external URLs.
2. Description of Rendered Image: Similar slide format, but the header "References" is in bold white font on a darker grey background, and the hyperlinks are also blue but the header appears visually more muted.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the contrast of the "References" header by adjusting its color to a lighter shade (e.g., white) to make it stand out more against the dark grey background.
