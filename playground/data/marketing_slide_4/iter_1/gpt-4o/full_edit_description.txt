1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a slide background with a red upper region, a black center section containing large text in white and light blue that reads "BIG QUESTION" and "HOW DO MARKETS HELP US?", topped with an orange ribbon-like graphic.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a completely black background with a more simplistic layout. The phrase "BIG QUESTION" is in blue, and "HOW DO MARKETS HELP US?" is in bold white text. The orange ribbon is absent, and the overall design is flatter and more minimal.
3. Change Suggestion: Add an orange ribbon-like graphic at the top left corner of the rendered image to match the style of the target image.
