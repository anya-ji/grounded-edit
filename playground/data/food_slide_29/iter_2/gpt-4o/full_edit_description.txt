1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clean layout with neatly aligned text. Question numbers are on the left, and the text is easily readable against a light background. The buttons and icons are styled consistently, with a light blue color scheme, and the "QUIZ & REVIEW ACTIVITY" button is clearly positioned at the bottom right.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has misaligned text and question numbers, with some text appearing in different font weights and styles. The button design is less cohesive, and the background appears more cluttered, with a darker blue button that stands out poorly against the background.

3. Change Suggestion: Align all question numbers uniformly to the left margin and standardize the font weight and style for all question texts to ensure a clean, cohesive look.
