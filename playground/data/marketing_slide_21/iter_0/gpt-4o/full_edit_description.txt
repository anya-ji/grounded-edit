1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a flowchart with specific labels ("Direct," "Retail," "Wholesale," etc.) in orange boxes connected by lines, placed on a light background. The title "Sales and Distribution" is centered at the bottom in a clear, prominent font.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also has a flowchart format with similar labels in orange boxes but lacks some connections, and the overall text appears smaller. The title "Sales and Distribution" is present but in a different font style, lacking prominence, and the background is dark.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font size of the title "Sales and Distribution" in the rendered image to match the size and font style of the title in the target image.
