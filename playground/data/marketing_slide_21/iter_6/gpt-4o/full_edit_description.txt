1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clear layout with labeled boxes for "Direct," "Retail," and "Wholesale" in a vertical alignment on the left, alongside "Producer or manufacturer" in the center, and "Retailer" and "Consumer" on the right in a structured format.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a disorganized arrangement with labels overlapping and misaligned, particularly the text "Producer or manufacturer," which is distorted and poorly positioned across the central box.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the positioning of the text "Producer or manufacturer" to be centered within its box and ensure it fits properly without overflow, maintaining consistent text size and alignment with other labels.
