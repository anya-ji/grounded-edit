1. Description of Target Image: The target image shows a flowchart with clearly structured boxes labeled "Direct," "Retail," "Wholesale," "Producer or manufacturer," "Wholesaler," "Retailer," and "Consumer," with a light background and horizontal and vertical connecting lines.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has similar boxes but appears less organized, with some text misaligned. The background is darker, and the text has less contrast, making it harder to read.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the text font size for all labels in the rendered image to improve readability and align the boxes so that they are evenly spaced and consistently placed.
