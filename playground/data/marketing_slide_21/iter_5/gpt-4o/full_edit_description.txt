1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a flowchart with orange boxes that contain text labels, arranged in a structured layout with connecting lines. The background is light, making the text and boxes prominent. The title "Sales and Distribution" appears at the bottom in a large font.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image presents a similar flowchart concept, but the boxes containing text are misaligned and some text overlaps. The background is darker, and the title "Sales and Distribution" is smaller and less prominent than in the target image.

3. Change Suggestion: Align the text boxes in the rendered image so that they match the structured layout of the target image, ensuring no overlapping text occurs.
