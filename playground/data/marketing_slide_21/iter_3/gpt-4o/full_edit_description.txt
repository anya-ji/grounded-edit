1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a flowchart with text boxes in orange, outlining various sales and distribution methods. The boxes are connected by lines, and the text is clearly readable with a dark background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but features a gray background. Some text boxes are positioned differently, and the text "Producer or manufacturer" appears cut off.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the placement of the text box containing "Producer or manufacturer" to ensure it is fully visible and centered in the box.
