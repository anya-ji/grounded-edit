1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a flowchart with a clear layout, orange boxes with consistent text alignment, and a darker background. The boxes contain terms related to sales and distribution like "Producer or manufacturer," "Retail," and "Consumer," which are well-organized and spaced out evenly. The title "Sales and Distribution" is also clearly visible with appropriate font size and color that matches the flowchart style.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image contains a similar flowchart but has several inconsistencies. The text in the boxes is misaligned, with some words extending outside their boxes, particularly "Producer or manufacturer," which is not clearly centered. Additionally, the background is a uniform dark gray, but the contrast between titles and text seems less prominent, making it harder to read. The spacing between boxes is uneven, making the layout look cluttered.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the alignment of the text within the box labeled "Producer or manufacturer" to be center-aligned, ensuring the text fits neatly within the box without extending beyond its borders.
