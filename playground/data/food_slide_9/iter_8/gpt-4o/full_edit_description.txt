1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clear, organized layout with distinct sections labeled "PART 1" and "PART 2," using a professional design with decorated boxes for questions and answer prompts. The font used is formal and easy to read with contrasting colors.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has similar labeling but uses a more casual, inconsistent color scheme and design. The background color is a light blue, and the labels have a different style with informal shapes, which may detract from readability and aesthetic consistency.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to a light gray and alter the label boxes to be rectangular with a solid border to improve clarity and professionalism.
