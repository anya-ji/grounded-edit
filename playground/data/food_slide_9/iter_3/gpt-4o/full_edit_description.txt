1. Description of Target Image: The target image has a blue background with a white text box and consists of two sections labeled "PART 1" and "PART 2," where questions and answers are displayed. The overall color scheme is bright and readable.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a yellow background with similar text sections, but the contrast is lower, making it harder to read. The layout is also less defined compared to the target image.

3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image from yellow to a shade of blue that matches the target image to enhance readability.
