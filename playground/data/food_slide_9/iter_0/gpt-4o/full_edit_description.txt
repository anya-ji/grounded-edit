1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a conversation interface where Joey is answering questions about his date, with a clearly visible subtitle displaying his dialogue.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also shows a similar conversation interface but lacks the subtitle, making it difficult to follow Joey's specific responses.
3. Change Suggestion: Add a subtitle layer that displays Joey's dialogue, which could be extracted from the video/audio track, ensuring it matches the style and position of subtitles used in the target image.
