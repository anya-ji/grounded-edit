1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clean, professional layout with a title at the top, followed by a bullet point list and an illustration of electronic media elements (a radio and a television) on the right.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar structure but includes a horizontal black line and a text box at the bottom that are not present in the target image, which disrupts its clean look.
3. Change Suggestion: Remove the horizontal black line and the text box at the bottom of the rendered image to match the clean layout of the target image.
