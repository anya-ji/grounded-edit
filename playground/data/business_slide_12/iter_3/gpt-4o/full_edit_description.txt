1. Description of Target Image: The target image features the text "NYC" prominently displayed in the foreground, with a background of the Brooklyn Bridge, showcasing a clear sky and distinct lighting that emphasizes the structure of the bridge.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image includes two instances of the text "NYC," one larger and partially obscured by the other, with a similar background of the Brooklyn Bridge and a sky that matches the target image in terms of structure but lacks the same clarity and focus.
3. Change Suggestion: Remove the second instance of the text "NYC" from the rendered image to match the target image's single-instance design.
