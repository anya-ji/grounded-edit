1. Description of Target Image: The target image shows a view of the Brooklyn Bridge with the text "NYC" prominently displayed in the foreground. The letters are crisp and uniform, with no visible imperfections. The color scheme has warm tones that enhance the overall aesthetic, and the text appears cleanly isolated from the background.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features the same view of the Brooklyn Bridge, with the text "NYC" displayed but with a noticeable visually uneven style, particularly where the letter "C" appears to have an extra stroke or shadow effect that distracts from its clarity. The background maintains similar tones but has a slightly washed appearance due to the text overlay.

3. Change Suggestion: Modify the font of the "C" in "NYC" in the rendered image to match the uniform style and clarity of the "N" and "Y" as seen in the target image, ensuring a consistent and clean appearance across all letters.
