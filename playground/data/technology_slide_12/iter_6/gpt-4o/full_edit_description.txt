1. Description of Target Image: The target image features the text "Thank You!" in a bold serif font with additional spacing between letters.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same text "Thank You!" in a standard serif font but with less letter spacing, making it appear more cramped.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the letter spacing (tracking) of the text "Thank You!" in the rendered image for a more open appearance.
