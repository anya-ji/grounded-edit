1. Description of Target Image: A captioned slide showing a short story about going on a date, with an image of two people skating in a park.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar slide that contains textual content but has a different layout and lacks the clarity of the image in the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the layout to center the image of the people skating and ensure it maintains a crisp resolution, rather than being smaller and less defined.
