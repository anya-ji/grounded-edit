1. Description of Target Image: The target image features the text “PART 4” at the top, with a light background and clear visibility of the text. The image includes a story about a date while skating with a relevant picture on the right side.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same text but is displayed on a darker gray background, making the text less legible. The image layout remains similar, but the background color affects the overall appearance.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to a lighter shade similar to that of the target image to enhance text visibility and match the target image's aesthetic.
