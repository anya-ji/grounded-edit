1. Description of Target Image: A scene showing two people skating in the park, one person has fallen down and appears to be laughing while the other assists them.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar scene, but the focus is off, as it shows two people kneeling and adjusting their skates without the action of falling or laughing.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the positioning of the figures in the rendered image so that one is visibly falling backward while the other is reaching out to assist, capturing the momentary action depicted in the target image.
