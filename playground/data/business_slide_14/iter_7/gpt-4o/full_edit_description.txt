1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a visually striking title "Innovations (Future Products or Services)" in a smaller, more balanced font placed at the top of the image, allowing for a clearer view of the detailed artwork underneath.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image contains the same title but uses a much larger, bolder font that overshadows the graphics and makes it harder to appreciate the details of the scenes depicted below.
3. Change Suggestion: Reduce the font size of the title "Innovations (Future Products or Services)" in the rendered image to match the size used in the target image, allowing more visibility of the underlying artwork.
