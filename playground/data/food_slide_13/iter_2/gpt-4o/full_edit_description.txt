1. Description of Target Image: The target image shows a large block of text with ordered events from a date, presented clearly with an unobstructed view of the text. There is no overlay or distracting elements, ensuring easy readability.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also displays a similar ordered list of events but includes a large pop-up (or image) at the right side, which partially obscures the text and disrupts its visibility.
3. Change Suggestion: Modify the layout to remove or reposition the pop-up image on the right side of the rendered image so that the text can be fully visible and readable.
