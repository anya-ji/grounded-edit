1. Description of Target Image: A structured text layout listing the events in Joey's second date with Sarah, with numbered points and clear bullet-point organization.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar event list but with inconsistent numbering style, merging some items into paragraphs rather than using bullet points, and lacking the same clear visual separation.
3. Change Suggestion: Alter the rendered image to ensure all event items are bullet-pointed and clearly numbered from 2 to 6 for better readability and organization.
