1. Description of Target Image: A colorful presentation slide with a title "THE CONTENT OF ART" in a gold box, followed by a bullet point explaining the content of art in a standard font and color against a vibrant background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar slide where the title is highlighted in yellow, making it stand out too much compared to the target image, and the bullet point content is not centered properly and has a different color scheme.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the title background from yellow to gold to match the target image and center-align the bullet point text for consistency.
