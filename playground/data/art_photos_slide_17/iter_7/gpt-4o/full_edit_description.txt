1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title section that reads "THE CONTENT OF ART" in a solid yellow background with a bold, black font. The body text appears in a clear and contrasting color against a textured artwork background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a title that reads "THE CONTENT OF ART" in a yellow box with a black outline, but the background is cluttered, and the text is less legible due to poor color contrast with the background.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the title background of the rendered image from yellow with a black outline to a solid yellow without an outline, ensuring the text "THE CONTENT OF ART" remains bold and the body text remains clearly legible against the background.
