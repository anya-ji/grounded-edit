1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a well-structured presentation slide titled "Obstacles that Elon faced," with key points listed in bullet form. The text is presented clearly with a large font size and adequate spacing, alongside a bold yellow box on the left side.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar title and content but lacks the visual organization and spacing found in the target image. The bullet points are cramped together, and the yellow box appears more faded and less defined.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the line spacing of the bullet points to improve readability and make it more visually similar to the target image.
