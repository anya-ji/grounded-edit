1. Description of Target Image: The target image is a well-structured presentation slide with a clean layout, featuring bold headings and visually distinct sections. The text is clearly spaced, with adequate use of bullet points that emphasize each key obstacle faced by Elon Musk. The background is a light color with contrasting yellow sections for emphasis.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image contains similar text content but lacks the clear structure and distinct formatting of the target image. The headings are cluttered, and the text is cramped together, making it difficult to read. The yellow sections seem inconsistent and do not enhance the visual clarity.

3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the spacing between paragraphs and bullet points to increase readability and mimic the well-organized layout of the target image. Specifically, implement padding of 10px above and below each bullet point and paragraph in the text container.
