1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a presentation slide with a yellow vertical bar to the left, clean typography for the title "Obstacles that Elon faced," and clearly formatted text blocks for each of the listed obstacles, maintaining consistent spacing and alignment.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout, but the yellow bar is more pronounced and incorrectly overlaps the title text. The text is formatted less neatly, with spacing issues and less alignment between the title and the text blocks.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the yellow vertical bar's width to ensure it does not overlap the title "Obstacles that Elon faced" and ensure consistent spacing between the title and text blocks for better alignment.
