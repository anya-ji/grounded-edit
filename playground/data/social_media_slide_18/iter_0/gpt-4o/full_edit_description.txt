1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title at the top, "Three perspectives on global cultural flows," with clear bullet points under the section "1. CULTURAL DIFFERENTIALISM." The text has consistent formatting and spacing, with a notable contrast in the background color being white.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same title, but the background is dark blue, and there is inconsistency in the spacing and formatting of the text, particularly in the second bullet point where "It" starts with a lowercase letter, deviating from the original style.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to white to match the target image.
