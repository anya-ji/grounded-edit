1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a header with a blue background, containing white text stating "Three perspectives on global cultural flows" and an enlarged title "CULTURAL DIFFERENTIALISM". The text below includes bullet points with a check mark symbol and proper formatting, emphasizing key points in a clear manner.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar header layout, but the title "CULTURAL DIFFERENTIALISM" is in a smaller font size, and there is inconsistency in the formatting of the bullet point text, specifically the use of bullet points and spacing.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font size of the title "CULTURAL DIFFERENTIALISM" in the rendered image to match the size in the target image, ensuring consistent formatting across the header.
