```
1. Description of Target Image: The target image has a blue background at the top, with white text following below that. The "1. CULTURAL DIFFERENTIALISM" section is in bold and clearly formatted. The bullet points are slightly indented and use a checkmark symbol.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also has a blue background at the top, but includes a darker blue fill that obscures the text. The section heading is bold, but the bullet points have no checkmark and are not formatted consistently with the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image from dark blue to a lighter blue that matches the target image's upper background color to ensure the text is clearly visible.
