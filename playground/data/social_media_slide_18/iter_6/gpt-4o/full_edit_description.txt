1. Description of Target Image: The title "Three perspectives on global cultural flows:" is displayed in a large font with a blue background. The section "1. CULTURAL DIFFERENTIALISM" is in a slightly smaller font and has a white background. The text that follows is in a standard font size.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The title is displayed with a blue background but uses a much larger font than the target image. The section "1. CULTURAL DIFFERENTIALISM" is also in a large bold font, causing it to stand out more. The rest of the text maintains a standard font size but lacks consistent representation.
3. Change Suggestion: Reduce the font size of the title "Three perspectives on global cultural flows:" to match the font size of the title in the target image to create consistency.
