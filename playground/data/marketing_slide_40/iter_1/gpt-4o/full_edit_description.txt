1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays several circular sections featuring different scenes, including a sculptor, a farming group, a market with produce, an artist, and an indoor mall, all framed within black circles against a textured background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features the same scenes but arranged in a grid format with a title above. The images are more spaced out and lack the circular framing from the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Apply circular cropping to each image in the rendered layout to match the circular framing of the target image.
