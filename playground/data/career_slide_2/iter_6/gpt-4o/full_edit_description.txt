1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a black background with white text that clearly displays the title and multiple bullet points explaining "top grades". The text is well-aligned and visually distinct.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar black background and white text, but it is missing some bullet points and has a notable section of text cutoff at the bottom, making it look incomplete.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the layout to ensure all text is fully displayed and add the missing bullet point about "top grades" to match the target image.
