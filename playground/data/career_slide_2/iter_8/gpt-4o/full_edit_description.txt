1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a dark background with white text that clearly defines "WHAT ARE 'TOP GRADES'?" at the top, followed by detailed bullet points explaining the concept.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar title but lacks the bullet points, and the background is plain black, making the text less visually engaging and informative.
3. Change Suggestion: Add bullet points to the rendered image outlining the detailed explanations of "top grades" to enhance clarity and visual structure.
