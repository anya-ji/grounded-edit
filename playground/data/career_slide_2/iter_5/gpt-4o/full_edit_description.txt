1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a dark background with white text that explains what "top grades" are, including several key points presented in bullet format. The text is well-structured with clear distinctions between bullet points and sections.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar background but lacks several key bullet points found in the target image. The text appears incomplete, with significant information missing compared to the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Add the missing bullet points. Specifically, include the first bullet point about the definition of "top grades" to make the rendered image more closely match the target image.
