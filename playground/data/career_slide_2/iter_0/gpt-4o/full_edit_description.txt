1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide with a dark background containing white text and highlighted points about "top grades" for students, with clear formatting and layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A presentation slide that has similar content but with a simpler black background and less structured text, making it appear more cluttered and less visually appealing.
3. Change Suggestion: Improve the text layout by adding bullet points to the section discussing the grading system, similar to the format in the target image.
