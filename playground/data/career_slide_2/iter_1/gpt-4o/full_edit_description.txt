1. Description of Target Image: A slide titled "WHAT ARE 'TOP GRADES'?" with a black background. The text is clearly laid out, with bulleted points providing detailed information about top grades in an educational context.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar slide with a black background and the title "WHAT ARE 'TOP GRADES'?" but missing the first bullet point and displaying a shorter text with insufficient spacing.
3. Change Suggestion: Add the first bullet point about what "top grades" typically refer to in the rendered image to match the target image.
