1. Description of Target Image: A title with dark blue text and a clean white background, featuring both a bold title and several bullet points with a checkbox next to them, highlighting the role of media in globalization.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar layout but with a different font color, where the title is dark blue and the bullet points are missing checkboxes, making it less visually coherent than the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Add checkboxes next to each bullet point in the rendered image to match the target image's format.
