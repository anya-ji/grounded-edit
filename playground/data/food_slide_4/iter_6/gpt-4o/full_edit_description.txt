1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a question prompt with cool-toned colors and circular designs, and the text is clear and well-formatted in three distinct points. The overall visual has a soft, appealing background with no visible empty spaces or outlines around the text boxes. 
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image presents a similar question prompt but has a stark white background, and the outline of a text box is visible, detracting from the overall aesthetic. The numbers are in blue circles, with increased spacing and inconsistent formatting, making it appear less polished.
3. Change Suggestion: Remove the outline of the text box around the question "What are some common etiquette mistakes to avoid on a first date?" and adjust the background color to match the soft, cool tones of the target image.
