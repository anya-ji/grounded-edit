1. Description of Target Image: The target image features clearly numbered questions in colored circles, with a prominent title and standard font formatting that enhances readability.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the questions numbered in blue circles but lacks the boldness and clarity of the title, and the text is less visually engaging due to the simple formatting.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font weight of the title "PART 2" to bold and use a larger font size to improve visibility and emphasis.
