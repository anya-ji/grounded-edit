1. Description of Target Image: The target image features three sections with colorful illustrations and text, clearly describing key reasons why academic success is important. Each section has a distinct background and legible fonts that stand out against the dark background.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image appears distorted with overlapping images and text that is difficult to read. The sections are misaligned, and the overall layout does not match the organized structure of the target image.

3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the layout by ensuring that each section is evenly spaced and aligned, maintaining clear separation between the illustrations and corresponding text to enhance readability and visual structure.
