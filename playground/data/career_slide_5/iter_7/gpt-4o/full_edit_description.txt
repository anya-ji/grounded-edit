1. Description of Target Image: A professional presentation slide with three sections labeled "Innovation and Technological Advancement," "Social Mobility and Equality," and "Civic Engagement and Informed Citizenship." Each section includes corresponding illustrations and text, with a cohesive design and layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: An incomplete and misaligned version of the target image, with text and sections overlapping and some content clipped or missing. The layout appears more chaotic and less visually appealing.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the alignment of the sections so that each title and accompanying illustration is centered and clearly separated from the others, ensuring no overlap and that all text is fully visible.
