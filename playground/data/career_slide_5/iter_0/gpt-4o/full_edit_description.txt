1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a well-structured layout with clear separations between three sections: Innovation and Technological Advancement, Social Mobility and Equality, and Civic Engagement and Informed Citizenship, each with distinct illustrations and appropriately sized text.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image presents an overcrowded and poorly organized layout where the sections overlap, leading to text strings merging together, making it difficult to read and comprehend.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the layout to increase the spacing between the three sections (Innovation and Technological Advancement, Social Mobility and Equality, Civic Engagement and Informed Citizenship), ensuring each section maintains clear separation to enhance readability and visual structure.
