1. Description of Target Image: The target image features bold checkboxes styled with a thicker border and an indented left margin, with the text appearing adjacent to the checkboxes.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows hollow checkboxes with a thinner border and no indentation, leading to a different visual alignment of the text relative to the boxes.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the border thickness of the checkboxes in the rendered image to match the thickness found in the target image.
