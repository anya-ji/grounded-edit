```
1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a properly formatted presentation slide with bold headings and bullet points clearly separated. Each bullet point begins with a checkbox and is spaced well, ensuring readability.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a bold heading but lacks consistent spacing between the bullet points, and the text runs together without the checkbox formatting seen in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Add checkboxes to the beginning of each bullet point and adjust the spacing between the bullet points to ensure they are evenly spaced for better readability.
