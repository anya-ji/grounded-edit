1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title that is bold and centered with checkmarks preceding each bullet point in a list.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title but uses bullet points instead of checkmarks, and the layout appears less appealing.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the bullet points to checkmarks for each item in the list to match the target image's style.
