1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clear and organized layout with bold text on a white background and a subtle abstract design that enhances readability without distracting from the content. The section header "Representational or Objective Art" is prominently displayed in yellow, with the subheading "B. Portrait" highlighted distinctly.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a more chaotic design with a colorful, swirling background that obscures the text's readability. The section header is still yellow, but the text is placed within a yellow box that contrasts poorly with the vibrant background, making it less legible.

3. Change Suggestion: Modify the background of the rendered image to a solid white or light color to enhance text readability and maintain the clarity seen in the target image.
