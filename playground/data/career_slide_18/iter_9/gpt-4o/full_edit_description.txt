1. Description of Target Image: The title reads "ACADEMIC WORLD AND PROFESSIONAL WORLD" with the "DEMANDS AND CHARACTERISTICS" subtitle in yellow, presenting a professional layout with a clear hierarchy of text.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The title has inconsistent capitalization, saying "ACADEMIC WORLD DEMANDS AND CHARACTERISTICS PROFESSIONAL WORLD" with the subtitle "AND" improperly displayed in yellow instead of maintaining a clean separation.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the positioning of the text "AND" to be non-existent in the title. Instead, ensure "ACADEMIC WORLD AND PROFESSIONAL WORLD" is separated clearly from "DEMANDS AND CHARACTERISTICS" in a standard font color without excess stylization.
