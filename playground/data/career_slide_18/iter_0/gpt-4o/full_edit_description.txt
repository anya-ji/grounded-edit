1. Description of Target Image: The text features bold and larger font sizes for headings with "WORLD" spaced apart and centered, while the overall color scheme is a more uniform style with consistent use of bullet points.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The text presents formatted headings where "WORLD" is not spaced apart, and the text layout is less cohesive, utilizing bullet points without a strict alignment.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font size of the word "WORLD" in the heading for better emphasis and apply a consistent spacing between "ACADEMIC" and "WORLD" to match the target image.
