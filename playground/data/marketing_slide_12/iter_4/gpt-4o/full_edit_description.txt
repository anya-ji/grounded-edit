1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a design with two text areas, where the first line is highlighted in orange and the second line in yellow, both contained within a transparent overlay. The background has a pattern of rounded lines with a gradient from dark to light, creating a visually appealing contrast.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same text content but incorrectly uses downward arrows as indicators, and the yellow highlight appears misaligned; the background pattern is similar but a bit misaligned compared to the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the alignment of the yellow highlighted text to perfectly match the alignment of the first text line in the target image, removing any misalignment.
