1. Description of Target Image: The target image features text in a dark background, with an orange and yellow downwards arrow pointing to the text. The text is clear and well-aligned within a white box that is cleanly designed.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but uses a black background. The text is less vibrant due to lack of contrast, and the alignment of the arrows appears slightly off.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to a dark but slightly brighter tone to improve text contrast and clarity.
