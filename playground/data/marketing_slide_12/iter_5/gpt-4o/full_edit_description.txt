1. Description of Target Image: The target image features text boxes with clear, white font against a black background. The text is organized in a clean and legible manner with one text box being highlighted with an orange arrow and the other with a yellow arrow. 
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but the text boxes have a different color scheme with a yellow and orange border. It uses white text with the background appearing darker than in the target image, making the text harder to read.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to black to match the background of the target image for improved text legibility.
