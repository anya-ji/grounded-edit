1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a dark background with two text boxes displaying the phrases "Define the term Marketing" and "Explain various things involved how products reach to market" in contrasting colors (orange and yellow) against a light section on the left.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a dark background with two text boxes, but the text boxes are empty without any content. The overall layout appears similar but lacks the text from the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Add the text "Define the term Marketing" to the top text box and "Explain various things involved how products reach to market" to the bottom text box, using the same font and color scheme as the target image.
