1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a black background with two orange and yellow arrows pointing downwards. Above the arrows, there are text sections that discuss defining marketing and explaining how products reach the market, with a focus on their alignment and positioning.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but changes the arrows to a blank white section. The text is positioned similarly but lacks the colored arrows and has an incomplete background, giving a less cohesive look.
3. Change Suggestion: Replace the blank white section on the left with a solid black background to match the black background of the target image and reintroduce the orange and yellow arrows to enhance visual coherence.
