1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a dark background with a prominent white and orange text that includes a downward arrow, forming a structured layout for information about marketing.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a black background with similarly structured text but lacks the colored arrows and has a different color scheme for the text and box, making it visually different from the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the text boxes from black to dark gray to match the target image's contrast and enhance visibility.
