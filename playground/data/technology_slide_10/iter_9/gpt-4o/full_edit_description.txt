1. Description of Target Image: The target image presents a clear, well-aligned diagram with text that is uniformly left-aligned and equally spaced checkboxes next to each point regarding the advantages of blockchain technology.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has misaligned text with a less consistent alignment of the checkboxes, and some text appears pixelated or poorly rendered, affecting the overall clarity.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the alignment of the checkboxes to ensure they are perfectly left-aligned with the text in each bullet point for consistency.
