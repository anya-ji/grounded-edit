1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide with clear text distinguishing the academic world and professional world; features sections titled "Goal and Focus" for each world, with bullet points outlining their goals, focus, settings, and atmospheres. The text is well-structured and uses a consistent color scheme of yellow for headings and a blue font for subheadings.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar presentation slide but with some text misalignment and inconsistency in font color; the text in certain areas overlaps or appears jumbled, causing readability issues, and the headings are not visually distinct.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the alignment of the text in the "Environment" section to eliminate overlaps and ensure clear separation of bullet points for improved readability.
