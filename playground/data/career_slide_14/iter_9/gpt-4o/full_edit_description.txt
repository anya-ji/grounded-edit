1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a well-formatted presentation slide on the academic and professional world, with clear distinctions in text colors and consistent font sizes for section headers and body text. 
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image contains variations in font size and color inconsistencies, particularly in the headings and body text, making it less visually appealing and harder to read. 
3. Change Suggestion: Ensure that all section headers are in a uniform font size (e.g., 32pt) and color (e.g., bright yellow) to match the style of the target image.
