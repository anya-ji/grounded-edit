1. Description of Target Image: The target image contains a poster contrasting the academic and professional worlds, featuring clear, distinct colored texts with visually organized bullet points under each section.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image similarly displays the poster, but the text color combinations for "Academic World" and "Professional World" are altered, making them less visually balanced, and the formatting of the text is inconsistent with unclear bullet point spacing.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the color of the "Professional World" text from green to the same shade of blue used for the "Academic World" heading to maintain visual consistency.
