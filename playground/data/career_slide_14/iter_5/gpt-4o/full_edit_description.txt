1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a well-structured layout with clearly defined sections and standard formatting, where the text is organized in a coherent manner, and the color themes for the headings and text are consistent.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has several issues with text formatting, including inconsistent font colors (yellow highlights inconsistent with the target), overlapping text, and misalignment that disrupts the overall readability and structure.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the font color of the highlighted text in the rendered image to match the consistent yellow and blue colors of the target image, ensuring proper alignment and spacing.
