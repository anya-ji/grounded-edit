1. Description of Target Image: The target image presents a clearly structured slide comparing the academic and professional worlds, featuring bold headings and distinct sections with clear formatting. The text is well-aligned and features consistent typography, specifically in the color and size of the text elements.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows a similar design, but there are multiple formatting inconsistencies, such as misaligned text, different font colors for certain elements, and an overall less polished appearance.
3. Change Suggestion: Standardize the text color for headings in the rendered image to match the target image, ensuring all headings are in the same color (blue for "ACADEMIC WORLD" and "PROFESSIONAL WORLD").
