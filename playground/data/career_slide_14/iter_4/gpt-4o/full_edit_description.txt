1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a presentation slide titled "ACADEMIC WORLD AND PROFESSIONAL WORLD," featuring sections on "Goal and Focus" and "Environment" with distinct yellow and blue text, formatted neatly on a dark background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title, but the text formatting is inconsistent, with some sections highlighted incorrectly in yellow and blue. Additionally, there are text overlaps and disordered alignment in several areas.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the "Goal and Focus" section text color to ensure it matches the target image: use yellow for "Goal" and "Focus" outlines and blue for the rest of the "ACADEMIC WORLD" text.
