1. Description of Target Image: The text "IMPORTANCE OF SKILLS BEYOND ACADEMICS" is bold and clearly readable in a large font size, with specific sections highlighted in yellow for emphasis against a dark background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The main title is bold but the sections do not stand out as clearly since they are in a lighter shade. The background appears darker in comparison to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the contrast of the text in the rendered image by adjusting the section headers (e.g., "Financial Literacy," "Leadership and Teamwork") to a brighter yellow color to match the brightness found in the target image.
