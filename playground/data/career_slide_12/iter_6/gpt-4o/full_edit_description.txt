1. Description of Target Image: The text is mostly in light gray color with the exception of certain headings and keywords, which are highlighted in yellow. The text appears well-organized and easy to read against a dark background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The headings and keywords are highlighted in yellow, but the overall text color is in bold white instead of light gray, making the content more vibrant but potentially overwhelming against the dark background. 
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the standard text from bold white to light gray (#D0D0D0) to create a softer contrast against the dark background.
