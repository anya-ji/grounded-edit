1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a presentation slide with a dark background, displaying text sections in light gray or white, and highlighted text in yellow for emphasis.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but displays the highlighted text in bright yellow, which is more visually striking compared to the lighter yellow in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the highlight color of the "Leadership and Teamwork," "Time Management," "Creativity and Innovation," and "Cultural Competence and Diversity" sections to a softer shade of yellow to match the target image's style.
