1. Description of Target Image: The target image presents a side-by-side comparison of two columns: "Academic World" and "Professional World," with clear labels and bullet points demonstrating their respective outcomes. The color scheme includes a dark background with blue and yellow text for clarity.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image mirrors the same concept, but the text labels are less distinct, with inconsistent font colors and styles, and there's a lack of defined structure in the bullet points for the Academic World.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the text color of the "Outcome" heading in the Academic World section from yellow to a contrasting color, like white, to enhance visibility against the dark background.
