1. Description of Target Image: The image contains a title "ACADEMIC WORLD AND PROFESSIONAL WORLD" at the top, with two sections labeled "ACADEMIC WORLD" and "PROFESSIONAL WORLD." Text under "ACADEMIC WORLD" includes information about degrees and certifications, while the "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" section covers achievement and compensation. The color scheme includes yellow and blue headings against a dark background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays the same title and section headings but with misaligned and overlapping text. The "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" header appears in yellow but is placed erratically while some sections are jumbled together or cut off, impacting readability.
3. Change Suggestion: Align the text in the "ACADEMIC WORLD" and "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" sections to ensure consistent spacing and clear legibility of all content, particularly ensuring the separation of bullet points and proper alignment of headers.
