1. Description of Target Image: The target image features distinct headings for "ACADEMIC WORLD" and "PROFESSIONAL WORLD," with the text "Outcome" and bullet points visibly formatted, including a light blue color for "ACADEMIC WORLD" and a bright yellow for keywords.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has altered formatting; "ACADEMIC WORLD" and "Outcome" are not as distinctly highlighted. The color for "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" is a muted yellow instead of bright yellow, and the structure appears less organized.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" text from muted yellow to a bright yellow (#FFA500) to match the target image.
