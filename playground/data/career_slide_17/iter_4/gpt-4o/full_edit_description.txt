1. Description of Target Image: A split screen displaying the "Academic World" and "Professional World" with structured text and distinct headings. The design features a dark background, with well-defined categories like "Outcome," "Degrees and Certifications," and "Achievement and Success" highlighted in specific colors (blue and yellow) for clarity.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar split screen but with a less organized layout. The text headers are jumbled, and colors used for headings are inconsistent with the target image. The "Academic World" and "Professional World" sections lack the prominent categorization seen in the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the heading color of "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" to yellow and ensure that the text aligns properly to match the structured layout of the target image.
