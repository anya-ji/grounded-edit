```
1. Description of Target Image: The target image features two sections titled "ACADEMIC WORLD" and "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" with contrasting colors and clearly readable text. The headings are formatted in blue for "ACADEMIC WORLD" and yellow for "PROFESSIONAL WORLD." Each section contains bullet points explaining key characteristics and outcomes, with a consistent layout and font size.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also features the same two sections but has different text colors, with "ACADEMIC WORLD" in blue and "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" in blue as well, thus lacking contrast. The text is less legible, and the formatting appears inconsistent.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the text color of the "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" heading from blue to yellow for better contrast and consistency with the target image.
