1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a header "5 Stages of Development of Media" followed by the title "5. DIGITAL MEDIA" prominently displayed, with a descriptive text that is properly centered and balanced alongside an illustrated graphic of a laptop surrounded by digital icons.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same content but has a less visually appealing layout; the text appears uneven and the titles are misaligned, making the overall impression less clean and professional.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the vertical alignment of the text to center it relative to the graphic, ensuring that both the title "5. DIGITAL MEDIA" and the descriptive content are evenly spaced and aligned with the graphic on the right.
