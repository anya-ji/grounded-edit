1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a bold blue header with the title "5 Stages of Development of Media," followed by the section "5. DIGITAL MEDIA" in a large font. The text is aligned to the left, and accompanied by a colorful graphic depicting various digital media elements, such as a laptop and social media icons, with proper alignment and spacing.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also includes the same blue header and section title but features a different font style for "DIGITAL MEDIA", which appears smaller and less prominent. The body text is aligned differently, and there is noticeable misalignment in the graphical elements surrounding the laptop.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font size of "DIGITAL MEDIA" to match the font size of the corresponding section title in the target image, and ensure it is bolded for consistency.
