1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a well-formatted layout with a prominent heading for "5 Stages of Development of Media," followed by clear bullet points that describe digital media, including its uses and benefits. Text is displayed in a visually appealing manner alongside a colorful graphic that depicts various digital icons.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image attempts to replicate the original layout but omits the bullet points formatting, resulting in a block of text that is less visually engaging. The heading remains, but the description text appears in a single paragraph without indentation or bullet points, affecting readability.

3. Change Suggestion: Reintroduce bullet points for the description of digital media to enhance readability and visual appeal, thereby matching the target imageâ€™s layout more closely.
