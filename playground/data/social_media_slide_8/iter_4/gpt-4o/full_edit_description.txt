1. Description of Target Image: The target image shows a blue header with the title “5 Stages of Development of Media” and a well-formatted text layout with bullet points. The bullet points are clearly defined and properly aligned, featuring a colorful illustration of a laptop and digital icons on the right side.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar blue header but the text is misaligned and the bullet points are not clearly defined. Additionally, the text alignment appears cluttered and the overall layout is less visually appealing.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the text alignment of the bullet points in the rendered image to be left-aligned and properly indented to match the neat alignment of the target image.
