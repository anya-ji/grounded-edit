1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays the title "5 Stages of Development of Media" with the subtitle "5. DIGITAL MEDIA" above a visually appealing illustration of a laptop surrounded by various digital icons and symbols. The text is primarily left-aligned and clearly formatted, with full bullet points describing digital media.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image contains the same title and subtitle, but the text is incorrectly formatted with missing bullet points and partial lines. The illustration remains consistent with the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the rendered image to include the full bullet points with proper text alignment under the subtitle, ensuring the formatting matches that of the target image.
