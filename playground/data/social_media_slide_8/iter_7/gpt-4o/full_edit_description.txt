1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a section titled "5 Stages of Development of Media," with a description of "DIGITAL MEDIA" prominently positioned below it. The background includes colorful digital icons surrounding a laptop graphic.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title but features text with missing formatting and incorrect placement. The laptop graphic is intact, but the accompanying text appears differently formatted and less visually integrated with the image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the formatting of the text in the rendered image to match the target image, specifically ensuring that the headings are bold and the paragraph follows the same layout and font style as the target image.
