1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a titled header, "5 Stages of Development of Media," followed by the section title "5. DIGITAL MEDIA" in a larger bold font. The content below has bullet points, describing digital media's characteristics in a clear layout with a colorful graphic alongside.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same titles and the same content as the target image, but the text layout is flawed. The section titles are horizontally aligned but lack proper emphasis. Additionally, the bullet points are not formatted correctly and appear more cluttered.
3. Change Suggestion: Ensure the section title "5. DIGITAL MEDIA" is bolded and enlarged to match the formatting of the target image, and apply proper bullet point formatting to clearly delineate each point under the section.
