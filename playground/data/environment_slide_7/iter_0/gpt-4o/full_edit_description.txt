1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clear layout with a prominently displayed title "NEGATIVE IMPACT" at the top, accompanied by textual content that discusses environmental issues. Below the text, there are two images: one depicting deforestation and the other showing pollution with smokestacks in an industrial setting. The overall background is a soft green color.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title "NEGATIVE IMPACT" and very similar text content, but the text has been altered slightly. The background color is a light green, which contrasts more sharply than in the target image. The images below the text are slightly darker, with a more pronounced pollution effect in the image on the right.

3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color to a softer shade of green, similar to the target image, to make the rendered image more closely match the target image.
