1. Description of Target Image: A text slide with a title "NEGATIVE IMPACT" and paragraphs of information about environmental issues, along with two images: one showing deforestation and the other illustrating pollution from industrial smokestacks.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar text slide with the same title and paragraphs, but the images appear less vivid, and the text color is bright green, which may be harder to read against the background.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the text color from bright green to a darker shade, such as dark green or black, to enhance readability against the background.
