1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a text slide titled "NEGATIVE IMPACT," featuring bullet points about environmental issues alongside two images: one depicting deforestation and the other highlighting pollution from factories.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also contains the same title and bullet points as the target image but features different images below the text. The left image is similar to the target, but the right image shows a more stylized depiction of pollution with a more abstract quality.
3. Change Suggestion: Replace the right image in the rendered image with a more realistic depiction of pollution that closely matches the target image's factory scene.
