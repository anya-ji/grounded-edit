1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a text section titled "NEGATIVE IMPACT" with a clean white background, accompanied by two images â€“ one showing deforestation and the other showcasing pollution with smokestacks, all arranged neatly.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same text section but on a green background, with the two images placed below the text. The layout appears less organized compared to the target image, and the text overlaps slightly with the bottom image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image from green to white to match the target image.
