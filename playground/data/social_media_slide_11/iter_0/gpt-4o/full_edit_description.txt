1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title in bold white text, set against a blue header, stating "Various Media drive Various forms of Global Integration," with a clear format and appropriate space between the title, subtitle, and paragraph text. The subtitle "GLOBAL INTEGRATION" is also formatted in bold and appears centered below the title.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar title and subtitle but lacks the bold formatting for the title. The text is slightly misaligned and there's an inconsistent spacing between the title and subtitle compared to the target image.

3. Change Suggestion: Make the title "Various Media drive Various forms of Global Integration" bold in the rendered image for consistency with the target image.
