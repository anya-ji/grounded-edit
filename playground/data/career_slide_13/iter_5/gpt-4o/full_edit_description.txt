1. Description of Target Image: The text in the target image is presented in a neat, organized layout with prominent bullet points and highlighted headings in white and yellow on a dark background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The text in the rendered image is misaligned, with bullet points appearing inconsistently, and the heading and text color schemes are not uniform, leading to a less polished look.
3. Change Suggestion: Align all bullet points consistently to the left and ensure all headings are in the same color (white for primary headings and yellow for subheadings) to enhance the text layout and readability.
