1. Description of Target Image: The target image features text with bullet points about various skills beyond academics, with the headings in larger, bold white font and bullet points listed in standard font. Some bullet points are highlighted with yellow text to emphasize key phrases.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays similar content, but the formatting differs; the headings are in white but less emphasized, and the yellow highlighting is missing for key phrases in the bullet points.
3. Change Suggestion: Add yellow highlighting to the phrases "Health and Wellness," "Digital Literacy," "Networking and Relationship Building," and "Conflict Resolution" in the rendered image to match the target image's emphasis.
