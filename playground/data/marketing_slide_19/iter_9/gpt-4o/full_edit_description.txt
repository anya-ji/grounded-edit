1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide showing a colorful hexagonal diagram representing the marketing mix with labels for "Product," "Price," "Promotion," and "Place," along with a central bubble labeled "Target Market," and the title "THE MARKETING MIX" at the top.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar slide layout but with the hexagonal diagram containing a blue circle for "Target Market," a lesser-defined color scheme, and the title positioned in a potentially inconsistent formatting style.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the hexagonal diagram to a more vibrant and consistent shade, making it match the color scheme of the target image more closely.
