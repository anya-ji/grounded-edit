1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a colorful hexagon diagram with the words "THE MARKETING MIX" in a muted background. The hexagons are labeled with "PRODUCT," "PRICE," "TARGET MARKET," "PLACE," and "PROMOTION," and there are arrows indicating a cycle around the "TARGET MARKET" label. 
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features the same hexagon diagram but is set against a black background. The text is bolder, and the overall color saturation appears higher, which affects the visibility of the diagram elements. 
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image from black to a soft blue gradient to match the target image's muted background, improving the overall visibility and consistency.
