1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a flowchart titled "THE MARKETING MIX" with hexagons in vibrant colors labeled "PRODUCT," "PRICE," "TARGET MARKET," "PROMOTION," and "PLACE," set against a darker background. The word "Marketing" is displayed prominently in white to the right.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image replicates the layout of the target image, with similar hexagons and text; however, the colors are less vibrant and more muted. The word "Marketing" is also displayed in white but is larger and bolder than in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Reduce the font size of the word "Marketing" to match the font size of the target image for consistency.
