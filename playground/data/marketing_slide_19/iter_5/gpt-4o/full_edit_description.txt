1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a visual representation of the marketing mix, with hexagonal shapes labeled "Product," "Price," "Promotion," "Place," and a central "Target Market." The background is a gradient blue-green with a clear overlay and a smaller title at the top.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image is similar but has a cleaner blue gradient background and includes a larger title at the top reading "THE MARKETING MIX," making it more dominant. The colors of the hexagons are retained, but the overall appearance is less coherent than the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background gradient of the rendered image to match the blue-green gradient style of the target image for a more cohesive look.
