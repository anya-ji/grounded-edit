1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a hexagonal diagram illustrating the marketing mix with "TARGET MARKET" prominently highlighted in the center. The design uses vibrant colors for each section and has a dark green background. The title "THE MARKETING MIX" is present at the top in a light color, and there is a blurred overlay effect in the background.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also shows a similar hexagonal layout with "TARGET MARKET" at the center, but the section colors are less vibrant and the overall color scheme is lighter. The title is duplicated as "THE MARKETING MIX," and the background gradient transitions from darker to lighter blue, lacking the overlay effect.

3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background of the rendered image to incorporate a dark green hue similar to the target image, with a subtle blurred overlay effect to enhance depth.
