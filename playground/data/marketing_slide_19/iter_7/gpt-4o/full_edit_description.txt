1. Description of Target Image: A diagram illustrating "The Marketing Mix" with hexagonal shapes labeled as PRODUCT, PRICE, PROMOTION, PLACE, and a central circle labeled TARGET MARKET, all set against a blurred teal background. The title "THE MARKETING MIX" is displayed in a larger font at the top left, and "Marketing" is shown in a smaller font on the right.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar diagram of "The Marketing Mix," but the colors of the shapes and the overall background are brighter teal, the text is larger and more rounded, and there is a duplicate mention of the title "THE MARKETING MIX" at the top.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background color to a slightly darker shade of teal, similar to the target image, to create a closer match with the overall tone.
