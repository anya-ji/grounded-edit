1. Description of Target Image: A slide titled "Dynamics of Local and Global Culture" with text that includes a bullet point list and spacing that creates a clean, organized layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar slide that has less spacing between paragraphs and no bullet points, resulting in a less visually appealing and harder-to-read format.
3. Change Suggestion: Add bullet points for the perspectives on global cultural flows in the rendered image to improve readability and organization.
