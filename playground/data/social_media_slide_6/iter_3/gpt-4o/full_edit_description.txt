1. Description of Target Image: The target image features the title "3. PRINTING PRESS" in a clear, bold font at the top, with a bullet point explaining its significance, providing a clear view of a printing press illustration aligned to the right.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar title but lacks bullet points and includes an additional sentence that makes the text appear cluttered, although it still features a printing press illustration.
3. Change Suggestion: Remove the additional sentence in the rendered image to streamline the text and match the cleaner layout of the target image.
