1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a diagram titled "3. PRINTING PRESS" with the description "It allowed the continuous production, reproduction and circulation of print materials." The text is divided into two bullet points with the first point bolded, and there is an illustration of a printing press alongside a person operating it, all on a clean background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title "3. PRINTING PRESS" but the description reads "continuous production, reproduction, and circulation of print materials." The text appears less structured without bullet points, and the illustration also depicts a printing press and a person, but there is more empty space on the left side of the image compared to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Add bullet points to the description text in the rendered image to match the structured format of the target image.
