```
1. Description of Target Image: The image features a printing press with a worker operating it, accompanied by text that is clearly structured and easy to read, with a title at the top and a bulleted explanation below.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image depicts a similar scene but has text that lacks a clear structure, and the font size appears smaller and less readable in comparison to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font size of the text in the rendered image to match the font size of the target image for better readability.
