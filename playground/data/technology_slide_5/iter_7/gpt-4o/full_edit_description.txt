1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title "The Technology used in Blockchain" in large, bold font, along with a list of concepts like "Cryptographic Keys," "Network Protocol," and others, displayed in a clean and organized manner with checkboxes on the left. The graphics on the right are colorful icons representing blockchain technology.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays the same title but with much larger font. The list of concepts is similar, but the checkboxes appear slightly misaligned, and the text is less visually balanced. Some icons are more prominently projected, drawing focus away from the title and list.
3. Change Suggestion: Reduce the font size of the title "The Technology used in Blockchain" to match the font size in the target image, ensuring a more balanced layout with the list of concepts.
