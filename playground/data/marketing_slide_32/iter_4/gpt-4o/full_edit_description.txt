1. Description of Target Image: The target image has the title "ELO's" in bold white font, with a distinctly larger size compared to the subtitle text, which is also in white. The subtitle consists of two lines: "Market and Opportunity" and "Market and Equality." The text is framed on a black background with a stylized, abstract white structure on the right side of the image.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title "ELO's" but in a larger size, followed by the subtitle text "Market and Opportunity" and "Market and Equality" in a smaller, lighter font. The background is black, and the structure on the right is similar to the target image but does not match exactly.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font weight of the subtitle text "Market and Opportunity" and "Market and Equality" to match the boldness of the title text "ELO's."
