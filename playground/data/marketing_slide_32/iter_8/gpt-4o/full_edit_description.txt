1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a design with the text "ELO's" prominently displayed above two bulleted items "Market and Opportunity" and "Market and Equality," with the text in a lighter color and a clean layout against a black background. The text is clearly legible and well-structured, with the bullets distinctly marked.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same content but presents the text in a darker shade for "ELO's," making it slightly less legible. The structure of the text is cluttered, and the spacing between the lines and bullet points is inconsistent.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the font color of "ELO's" from a darker shade to a lighter shade (e.g., change from dark gray to light gray) to improve legibility and match the target image's clarity.
