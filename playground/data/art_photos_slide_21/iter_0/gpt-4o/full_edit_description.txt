1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a header with the title "The Subject and Content of Art" in a solid yellow background, followed by a section labeled "Three levels of meaning" with a white background for the text, and the text itself is clearly visible in a black font.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar title but uses a yellow header with a brighter yellow text, making it harder to read. The section for "Three levels of meaning" has a more chaotic background with less contrast and the text is in a white box.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the header background of the rendered image to a solid yellow to match the target image's clean appearance, improving readability.
