1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays two distinct logos, "Belo" on the left with a clean, white, solid line style, and "Community" on the right with a similar shape but featuring a painterly, imperfect line style. Both logos are set against a solid coral background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image mirrors the layout of the target image but has a slightly different color in the "Community" logo on the right, showing a more transparent, washed-out effect and a less distinct shape compared to the original.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the opacity of the "Community" logo in the rendered image to match the solid white opacity of the target image, ensuring the edges are sharp and the logo has the same vibrancy.
