1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide featuring a cartoon character in a confused pose against a backdrop of large, floating numbers, with a clear title and subtitle. The title is bold and brightly colored.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar slide, but the character is smaller and more to the side, with a different color layout for the title which appears less prominent. The subtitle text overlays the title and is in a less readable font color.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the size of the title text "Are Top Grades Enough?" and change its color to match the bright yellow hue in the target image for better visibility.
