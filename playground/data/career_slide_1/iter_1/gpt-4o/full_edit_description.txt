1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a character looking confused in front of a background filled with numbers. The text "Are Top Grades Enough?" appears prominently, with the website information "TopicsForSeminar.com" below it, all in a well-balanced layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image contains the same background and character but has different text placement and style. The main text is cluttered, and "TopicsForSeminar.com" appears misaligned and less legible, emphasizing "Top Grades" disproportionately.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the main text position to center-align "Are Top Grades Enough?" and ensure the text "A presentation by" and "TopicsForSeminar.com" are aligned properly below it, using clearer fonts and consistent sizing.
