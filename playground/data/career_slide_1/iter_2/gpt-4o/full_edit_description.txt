1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a cartoon character looking puzzled, surrounded by floating numbers. The title "Are Top Grades Enough?" is prominently displayed in a balanced, contrasting format against a dark background, with the website name below it in a red box.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image contains the same cartoon character and numbers, but the title "Are Top Grades Enough? Top Grades" appears cluttered with incorrect word placement and yellow font. The website name is in blue without the red background, losing some visibility and impact.
3. Change Suggestion: Reposition and adjust the title text to read "Are Top Grades Enough?" only, using a balanced layout with the website name "TopicsForSeminar.com" in the red box below, similar to the target image.
