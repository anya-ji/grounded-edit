1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a white box with a yellow header labeled "Representational or Objective Art," containing examples of still life, all presented with clear, concise formatting and appropriate color contrast.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a yellow header similar to the target image but uses a stark white background for the text box, resulting in poor readability. The text "Examples:" appears in regular font, contrasting with the bold format of the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the text box background color from white to a soft light gray to improve readability and match the color scheme of the target image better.
