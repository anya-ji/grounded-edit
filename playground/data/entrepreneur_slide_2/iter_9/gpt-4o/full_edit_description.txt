1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a content slide with bold headings and subheadings, all formatted in a clear and uniform font. The overall layout has consistent spacing, and the text is aligned properly for readability. 
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image contains a similar content slide but features inconsistent text formatting. The headings are bold, but some subheadings have varied casing and spacing issues, making it less visually appealing and harder to read.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the subheading "Lessons that we can learn from Elon Musk's life" in the rendered image to match the title casing and spacing of the other subheadings in the target image, specifically changing it to "Lessons That We Can Learn From Elon Musk's Life."
