1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a content slide with a distinctive yellow vertical bar on the left, and the word "Content" is prominently displayed in bold and italic font.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image presents a similar slide without the yellow vertical bar. The word "Content" is displayed in a simple bold font but lacks the italic formatting.
3. Change Suggestion: Add a yellow vertical bar on the left side of the slide to match the target image and format the word "Content" to be both bold and italicized.
