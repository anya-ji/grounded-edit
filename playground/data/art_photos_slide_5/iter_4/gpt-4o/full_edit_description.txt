1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a slide with a yellow title banner and black text, set against a colorful abstract background. The text is clear and legible.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar design but features the title in a more vibrant yellow and presents the text with less contrast against a similarly colorful background, making it less legible.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the contrast of the black text by adjusting its opacity or adding a slight shadow effect to make it more legible against the background.
