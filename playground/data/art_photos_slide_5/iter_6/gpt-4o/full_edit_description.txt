1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a text block with a yellow background at the top, a white box containing aligned text below, and a colorful abstract background that complements the text.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a yellow header but features misaligned text that overlaps with the bottom white box, creating a cluttered appearance. The abstract background is less vibrant and more chaotic.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the text alignment in the rendered image to ensure the text within the white box is properly aligned and does not overlap with other elements.
