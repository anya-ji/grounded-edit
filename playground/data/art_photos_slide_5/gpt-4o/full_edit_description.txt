<edit>Change the font size of the title "The Subject and Content of Art" to a larger size, such as 36pt, to enhance visibility.</edit>
<edit>Adjust the background color of the title area to a solid color, preferably a darker shade of yellow, to improve contrast with the text.</edit>
<edit>Move the bullet point ("âœ“") before "The subject is directly represented..." to align it vertically with the text above it, ensuring proper spacing.</edit>
<edit>Set the text color of the body to a darker shade, such as black, for better readability against the background.</edit>
<edit>Add a slight padding of 10px around the text box containing the bullet point to ensure it doesn't touch the edges of the slide.</edit>
