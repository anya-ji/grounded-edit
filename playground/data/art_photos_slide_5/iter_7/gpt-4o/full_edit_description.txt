1. Description of Target Image: A colorful background with text that highlights "Two kinds of Art as to Subject," accompanied by a clearly structured point about "Representational or Objective Art," with bullet points and visual emphasis on the text.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar colorful background with the same heading and point, but the text structure is less organized, and there is inconsistency with the bullet point presentation and color contrast.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background color of the text box containing the point about "Representational or Objective Art" to match the white background of the target image for better readability and visual consistency.
