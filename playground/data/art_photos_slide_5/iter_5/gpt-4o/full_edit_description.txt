1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a yellow-highlighted header with a clean white area beneath it containing black text that is formatted neatly, with some parts bolded for emphasis, against a colorful, abstract background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but the header is bright yellow while the body text appears on a white area that shows disorganized formatting and lacks the same bold emphasis, along with a more chaotic background blending yellow and orange colors.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the body text in the rendered image to use bold formatting for the phrase “directly represented in the artwork like the subjects seen in portraits and other realistic visual art presentations” to match the target image.
