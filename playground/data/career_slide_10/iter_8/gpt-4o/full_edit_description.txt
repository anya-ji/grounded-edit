1. Description of Target Image: A professionally designed graphic featuring four prominent figures (Richard Branson, Mark Twain, Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey) with clear images and well-organized text beneath each image.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A less polished version of the same graphic where the images appear misaligned, and the text overlaps and is partially obscured, creating a cluttered appearance.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the alignment of the images and text to ensure consistent horizontal spacing and eliminate any text overlap.
