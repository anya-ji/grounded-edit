1. Description of Target Image: A black background displaying four famous figures (Richard Branson, Mark Twain, Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey) with their respective names and descriptions below each image, all clearly visible.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar layout to the target image, but the background is dark, the image positioning is misaligned, and the text overlaying the individuals' images is poorly formatted.
3. Change Suggestion: Align the images of the four figures such that they are centered with equal spacing between them, and ensure that the names and descriptions are fully visible and not overlapping with other elements in the rendered image.
