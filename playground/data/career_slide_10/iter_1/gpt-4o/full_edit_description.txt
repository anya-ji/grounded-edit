1. Description of Target Image: A visually appealing layout showcasing four individuals with their images centered, accompanied by their names and brief descriptions, all set against a black background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A poorly aligned layout where the images of the individuals are misaligned and the text is distorted and overlaps the images, making it difficult to read.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the alignment of the images and text to ensure proper spacing between elements, ensuring that each image is centered above its corresponding text without any overlap.
