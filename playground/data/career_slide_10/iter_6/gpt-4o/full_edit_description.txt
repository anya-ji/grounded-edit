1. Description of Target Image: A well-composed graphic featuring four notable individuals (Richard Branson, Mark Twain, Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey) with their names and brief descriptions displayed below each photo, set against a dark background with a motivational quote at the top.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similarly structured image but with misaligned text and some of the portraits presented in an incorrect order, resulting in a cluttered appearance and loss of clean design.
3. Change Suggestion: Center-align the text of each individual so that it matches the alignment seen in the target image.
