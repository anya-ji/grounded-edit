1. Description of Target Image: A clear and organized text layout with a specific section divided for "PAST SIMPLE" and "PAST CONTINUOUS" categories, featuring readable font styles and spacing.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A similar layout but with some misalignment and overlapping text, making it harder to read; the section headers are slightly misplaced.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the positioning of the "PAST SIMPLE" and "PAST CONTINUOUS" headers to ensure they align properly with their respective sections and eliminate any text overlap.
