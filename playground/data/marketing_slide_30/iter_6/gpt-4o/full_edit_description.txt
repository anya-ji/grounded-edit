1. Description of Target Image: The image features two lines of text over a textured background, with the top line in an orange box and the bottom line in a yellow box.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays the same text content but lacks the colored background boxes, with the text instead directly overlayed on the background.
3. Change Suggestion: Add rounded orange and yellow background boxes behind the respective lines of text to match the target image.
