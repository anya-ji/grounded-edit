1. Description of Target Image: The target image has two text overlays, one in orange stating "Differentiate between different types of market," and another in yellow stating "Explain why society need different types of market."
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image features similar text overlays, but the first text is in orange and the second is in yellow, with differing alignment and possibly formatting.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the font size of the yellow text in the rendered image to match the font size of the orange text, ensuring both overlays appear consistently sized.
