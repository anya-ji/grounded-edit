1. Description of Target Image: The target image features overlay text; the top line is in orange, and the bottom line is in yellow, with a detailed and organized background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image includes the same background but has the text in a different shade of orange and yellow, resulting in a mismatch in color.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the top overlay text to a specific shade of orange (#FF7F00) and the bottom overlay text to a specific shade of yellow (#FFFF00) to match the target image.
