```
1. Description of Target Image: The target image features overlay text in orange and yellow against a striped background. The orange text is above, while the yellow text is below, both clearly readable and centered.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has overlay text in a more vibrant orange and yellow but lacks proper styling and placement, resulting in a less polished look with the orange text being too bold and the yellow slightly misaligned.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the yellow text color to a softer shade and center both texts vertically within their respective sections for improved alignment and readability.
