1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a colorful abstract background with a yellow banner at the top and the title "The Subject of Art" in white text on a yellow background. The body text is neatly formatted and contained within a white box, ensuring readability against the vibrant backdrop.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar abstract background but the title is in a yellow box with white text. The main body text is placed in a larger white box, which makes the text more prominent but disrupts the overall layout and balance compared to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the size of the white box containing the main body text in the rendered image to match the proportion and positioning of the white box in the target image.
