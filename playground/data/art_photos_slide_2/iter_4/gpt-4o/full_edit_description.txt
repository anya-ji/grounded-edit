1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a header and body text with a colored background, displaying the main points about the subject of art. The header is on a yellow background, with the body text in black.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same content but with a yellow background for the body text instead of the black font on a white background, making it less visually distinct.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the body text color from yellow to black to ensure higher contrast and readability against the background.
