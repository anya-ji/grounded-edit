1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a colorful background with multicolored brush strokes, along with a title bar at the top and text that is bold for emphasis within a text box.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has similar brush strokes but the title is prominently bolded and larger than in the target image, and the text box is also present but lacks the same bold emphasis on the sentences.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the font weight of the text in the rendered image's text box to bold to match the emphasis seen in the target image.
