1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title banner with a yellow background and text that is partially outlined, giving it a prominent look against a textured background with warm colors of red, yellow, and orange.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows a similar title banner, but the background is dominated by orange tones, and the text appears in a plain white box without the outlined effect present in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Modify the text box background to have a transparent overlay, and add a darker outline around the text to replicate the outlined effect in the target image.
