1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a stylized background with blended colors, an emphasized title "The Subject of Art," and two text boxes that contain specific text with some differences in formatting and layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar background but differs in text layout. The title "The Subject of Art" is presented in a box, and the text lacks the second box and has different wording than the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the layout to include two distinct text boxes, ensuring the second text box contains the line "An artwork can be identified by its subject."
