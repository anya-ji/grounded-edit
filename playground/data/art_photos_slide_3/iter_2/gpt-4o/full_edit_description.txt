1. Description of Target Image: The text "The Subject of Art" is prominently displayed at the top, with a background featuring abstract colors and patterns. Below the title, two paragraphs of text are included, with the second paragraph justified to the left.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The text "The Subject of Art" is also at the top, but the background colors are different and more pastel-like. The second paragraph of text is centered instead of justified, which creates a difference in alignment compared to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the alignment of the second paragraph of text in the rendered image from center-aligned to left-aligned.
