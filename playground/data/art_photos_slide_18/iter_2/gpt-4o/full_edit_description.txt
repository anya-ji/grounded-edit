1. Description of Target Image: The target image displays a presentation slide with an orange border and a muted background featuring an abstract design. The text is organized in a clear format, with check marks next to each point, creating an aesthetically pleasing layout.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same content but has a solid yellow background that feels bright and overwhelming. The text lacks check marks and the border is absent, leading to a less refined appearance.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to a more muted tone, similar to the target image, and add a thin orange border around the slide.
