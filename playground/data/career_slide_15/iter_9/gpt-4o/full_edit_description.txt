1. Description of Target Image: A presentation slide comparing the Academic and Professional worlds, with distinct text colors and proper alignment. Key points are clear and evenly spaced.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A presentation slide that shows the same comparison but has inconsistencies in text size and alignment; some sections appear misaligned and overly bold.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the text size of the section titles to ensure uniformity with the target image, particularly making the title "Academic World and Professional World" consistent with the target image.
