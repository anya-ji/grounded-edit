1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a clear separation between the "ACADEMIC WORLD" and "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" sections, with the titles in blue and yellow respectively. The layout is well-structured, and the fonts are consistent throughout. The overall presentation is clean and easy to read with minimal distractions.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a less organized layout with the titles overlapping slightly. The "ACADEMIC WORLD" section is in blue, but the font weight is inconsistent, making it harder to read. Additionally, the title of the document has extra characters and lacks the clean structure seen in the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Modify the font weight of "ACADEMIC WORLD" in the rendered image to match the regular weight used for the "PROFESSIONAL WORLD" title, ensuring both titles maintain a consistent appearance.
