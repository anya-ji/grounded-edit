1. Description of Target Image: The target image contains the text "ENVIRONMENT" in a large, bold, green font at the top, with proper formatting and spacing. Below it, there are bulleted points explaining the concept of environment, all formatted neatly with a clear image on the right side showing a hand holding a tree.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has the same title "ENVIRONMENT" but in a less bold style and slightly altered green color. The bulleted points are not formatted properly, displaying as plain text without bullets. The image on the right remains consistent with the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the "ENVIRONMENT" title text to a bold shade of green (#4CAF50) and increase the font weight to ensure it closely matches the target image style.
