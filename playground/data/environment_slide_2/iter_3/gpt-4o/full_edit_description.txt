1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a green slide titled "ENVIRONMENT" with text detailing the components of the environment. The background is a light green color, and the text and image are well-contrasted making it easy to read.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also has the same title "ENVIRONMENT" but features a darker green background. The text is in green as well, which reduces contrast, making it harder to read.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the rendered image to a lighter shade of green to improve text contrast and readability.
