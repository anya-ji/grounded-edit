1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh with a vibrant background and white space surrounding it; the text "Representational or Objective Art" is displayed above the portrait, contrasted with a yellow box framing the text and a yellow label beneath the portrait.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image also shows the same self-portrait of van Gogh but has a blue background. The text "Representational or Objective Art" is highlighted in yellow, but lacks the framing contrast and is positioned higher in the image. Below the portrait, the label is also highlighted in yellow.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background of the rendered image from blue to white to match the background of the target image.
