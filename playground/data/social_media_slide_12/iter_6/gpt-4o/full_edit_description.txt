1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title and two bullet points about economic globalization. The title is centered and bold, and the text is neatly organized with appropriate spacing and alignment.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar title and bullet points but lacks proper alignment. The title is cut off, and the text has inconsistent spacing, leading to a cluttered appearance.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the position of the title and ensure it is fully visible by increasing the top margin of the text box containing the title.
