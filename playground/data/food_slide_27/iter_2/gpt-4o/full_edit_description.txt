```
1. Description of Target Image: The target image contains a visually appealing slide with step-by-step instructions for a class activity, featuring a colorful header and two clearly distinguished sections for the activity prompts.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image is similar but lacks the visual appeal of the target image, with a plain header and no distinct separation of the sections.
3. Change Suggestion: Add a colorful gradient background to the header section and implement distinct borders or shading to separate the instruction sections more clearly.
