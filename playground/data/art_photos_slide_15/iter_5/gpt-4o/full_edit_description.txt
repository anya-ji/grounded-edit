1. Description of Target Image: The left side features a vibrant, textured abstract artwork with a mix of colorful brush strokes, predominantly in bright greens, reds, yellows, and blues. The right side shows a chaotic composition with splashes of color and overlapping lines, mostly in yellows, reds, and blues. The overall tone is lively and dynamic.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The left side has a similar abstract artwork but appears less textured and more flat, with duller colors and less variation in brush stroke intensity. The right side also resembles the original but has a more uniform background and less varied color distribution.

3. Change Suggestion: Increase the texture of the paint on the left side of the rendered image by applying a "roughness" texture filter to enhance the depth and contrast of the colors.
