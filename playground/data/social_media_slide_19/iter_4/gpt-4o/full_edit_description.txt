1. Description of Target Image: A slide titled "Three perspectives on global cultural flows" with a white background, featuring bullet points about cultural hybridization, clearly formatted text, and a green checkmark symbol at the start of one line.
2. Description of Rendered Image: A slide with the same title but a dark blue background, featuring the same content, but the text is less readable with inconsistent spacing and an incorrect symbol (a checkmark inside the text rather than preceding the line).
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background of the rendered image to white to match the target image.
