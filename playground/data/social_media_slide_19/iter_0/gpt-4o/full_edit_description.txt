1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a presentation slide with the title "Three perspectives on global cultural flows" at the top, followed by the main heading "2. CULTURAL HYBRIDIZATION" prominently displayed. The text content is clearly legible with appropriate spacing and contrast against a light background. Some bullet points are partially visible, with correct punctuation and typography.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows a similar slide with the title and heading present, but the overall design is darker with a blue background that affects text readability. There are minor typographical issues, such as inconsistent spacing in the first bullet point.

3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the background color of the rendered image to a lighter shade similar to the target image to improve text contrast and readability.
