1. Description of Target Image: The title "The Subject and Content of Art" is displayed with a yellow background and black text. Below, there is a list of sources in black text on a white background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The same title is shown, but with a bright yellow background and a variation in the text color. The list of sources is presented in white text against a gradient background, making it less readable.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the list of sources in the rendered image from a gradient to a solid white background to enhance readability.
