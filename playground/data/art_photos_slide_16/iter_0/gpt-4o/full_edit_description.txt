1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title and content area with a background that has warm tones and a colorful, abstract design. The text is predominantly black and white, with yellow highlights for specific sections.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar abstract design but features a bright yellow background for the title and some sections of text, which slightly detracts from the overall aesthetic compared to the target image.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the title "Non-representational or Non-objective Art" in the rendered image from bright yellow to a more muted shade that matches the warm tone of the background in the target image.
