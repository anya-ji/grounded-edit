1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a title at the top reading "The Subject and Content of Art" in a yellow bar, with "Non-representational or Non-objective Art" in bold black text. Below, a list of sources is displayed in white text against a colorful abstract background.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar title layout but uses a bright yellow background for "Sources of the Subject" and the main text is in white against an orange and yellow color scheme, creating less contrast.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background color of the "Sources of the Subject" text box in the rendered image from bright yellow to white to create better contrast with the text and match the target image.
