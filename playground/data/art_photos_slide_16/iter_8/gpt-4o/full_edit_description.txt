1. Description of Target Image: The target image features text on a yellow background at the top and a white panel with a list of subjects below, with a faded multicolored background of swirling patterns.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a yellow banner at the top but uses an orange panel for the subject list instead of white, and the text for "Sources of the Subject" is in orange, leading to less contrast and visibility.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the background of the "Sources of the Subject" text panel in the rendered image from orange to white to improve contrast and match the target image.
