1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a bold yellow header titled "The Subject and Content of Art" with a bright background that includes swirling colors. The text under the title is visually clear, with bullet points listed in a widely spaced format on a white background for better readability. 

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but lacks the clarity and spacing of the target image. The title has a yellow background but is less distinct, and the bullet points are set against a white box that is not well-defined, making it harder to read.

3. Change Suggestion: Enhance the contrast of the white background box containing the bullet points by adding a subtle drop shadow to create better separation from the background, improving readability.
