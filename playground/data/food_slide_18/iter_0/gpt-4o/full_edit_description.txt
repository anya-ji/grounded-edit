1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a dialogue section with a light blue speech bubble and a clear layout, displaying text that is easy to read, along with a header that says "PART 2" in bold, and question numbers 1 and 2 listed below the dialogue.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar dialogue section but lacks the speech bubble's clarity and has reduced text contrast against the background; the header is in a lighter font, making it harder to distinguish.
3. Change Suggestion: Increase the contrast of the dialogue text by darkening it or changing the background color of the dialogue area to make the text more legible.
