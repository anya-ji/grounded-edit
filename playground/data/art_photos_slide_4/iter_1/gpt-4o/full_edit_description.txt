1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a prominently displayed cat catching a bird, with a plain background that emphasizes the art piece and a clearly defined title and description at the top.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows the same cat catching a bird but has a chaotic background with bright colors and swirls which distracts from the artwork. The title and description are placed in a less visually impactful manner, with some elements overlapping.
3. Change Suggestion: Replace the chaotic background with a solid color or a soft gradient that complements the cat and bird artwork, ensuring that the title and description are clear and unobstructed.
