1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a group of stylized figures with a distinct figure highlighted in white, positioned centrally, against a soft background gradient.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image shows a similar arrangement of stylized figures, but the highlighted figure is rendered in a slightly different style and color, with an overall brighter backdrop.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the color of the highlighted figure in the rendered image from bright white to a soft white with a slight transparency, to match the more subtle display in the target image.
