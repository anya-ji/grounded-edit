1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a bold title with specific formatting and text structure, including indentation and spacing between the bullet points, giving a clean and organized appearance.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar layout but lacks proper indentation and consistent bullet point spacing, leading to an unrefined presentation. The title is also in a heavier font, making it less visually appealing compared to the target.
3. Change Suggestion: Adjust the bullet point indentation to align with the target image, ensuring that each bullet point is properly indented and the spacing between them is consistent.
