1. Description of Target Image: The target image presents a neatly formatted text with bullet points, a bold title, and consistent spacing between lines and points.
2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image displays similar content but uses dashes instead of bullet points, has inconsistent spacing, and the title is not bold.
3. Change Suggestion: Change the dashes in the rendered image to bullet points and ensure the title "Early life of Elon Musk" is bolded for consistency with the target image.
