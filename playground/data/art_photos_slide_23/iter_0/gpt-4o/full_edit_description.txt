1. Description of Target Image: The target image features a header "KEEPING ART" in bold black text, followed by the section title "2. Museums and Private Collections" also in bold. The text description appears as a list item, formatted as a block of text without bullet points, and is clearly presented against a colorful background with a slightly faded effect.

2. Description of Rendered Image: The rendered image has a similar header "KEEPING ART" at the top in bold yellow text. The section title "2. Museums and Private Collections" is positioned beneath it but is shown as a list item with a bullet point in front of the text. The background is also colorful but has a different color distribution, with contrasting shades.

3. Change Suggestion: Change the bullet point in front of the section description to remove it, transforming it into a block of text like in the target image.
